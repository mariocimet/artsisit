The points that Asad makes are larger social constructionist ones and I can understand why Prof. Slingerland specifically declares from the outset that he wants to avoid such a tangled mess; if we press up against strong social constructionism it may limit what we get out of this class. But Fitzgerald has a much more limited argument, that using the *word* ""religion"" generally hurts us more than it helps us, strictly from a rhetorical point of view. After all, it is an English/European word that lacks a meaningful parallel in Chinese (or Japanese, Sanskrit, etc.); it was born out of early modern Christian sectarianism and the failure to establish a universal church.So, the idea of religion we adopt in this class, as a cultural standard with a ""soteriology"", may actually be inspiring us to impose a sort of Protestant imaginary onto ancient China. Keep in mind that religious studies often assumes ""religion"" to take the form of a ""system of symbols"", after Geertz. But can we really say that Warring States Taoism was a ""system"", or that its ""soteriology"" promises rewards of a similar kind to Christianity? Might it not be better to consider Taoism as some loosely related propositions about language and the mind, something like what you might hear from cognitive scientists if you get them drunk and ask them to share their wildest ideas about human nature? Perhaps if we keep that image in our heads, we might conclude that the word ""religion"" does little to help us understand what the ancient Chinese were thinking.However, I get the larger point -- that Chinese thought makes exciting propositions which run counter to all of our modern assumptions about how a good life is lived.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5557776,,0,1413351745916,1.41335E+12,2,,,"['893549', '4921047']",

There isn't such a thing as a purely ""hot"" model or a purely ""cold"" model in practice. Everyone is somewhere along that continuum and if they're closer to one end than the other we start attaching labels.Daniel Kannemann, who invented the idea of System 1 and System 2, used the image of being asked the question ""what is 2 + 2"" and then the question ""what is 37 x 17""? You don't think about the answer to the first question. You simply know that it is ""4"". You must stop and think about the second; do some calculation; maybe check your answer; certainly take some time before you say ""629"". Thus, System 1 and System 2. However, I know some kids with developmental challenges who can't even understand the first question and others who can only do it with extreme effort. I can't do the second quite as quickly as the first but if they're two digit numbers I can beat a kid with a calculator every time. It is almost purely System 1 for me. You might not be able to do it without a pencil and paper. The next person might need a calculator. Thus System 2. I met a women in my undergraduate days who could multiply five digit numbers as quickly as I do two digit numbers. Someone beat her using a calculator but their answers differed. It took her two seconds to point out which key the calculator operator had pushed in error. Multiplication for her is system 1. A purely virtue model might assume that you just know what is right and do it without thought. Confucius allowed you to be taught the right way and required that you think about the right way so that you would know to simply act in the right way without thinking. Zhuangzi wanted you to be ""spontaneous"" like Butcher Ding but even the good butcher admitted that it took him time to cultivate the spontaneity of his skill. Mozi required carrots and sticks to encourage you to think correctly and to not think incorrectly. Sunzi wanted you to look at things ""objectively"" which seems to involve very ration thinking to me. Qin Shihuang just used sticks. It's a continuum. No one is purely one model or the other. I urge not getting stuck on the labels but seeing what each actually said; comparing them; and attempting to place their ideas along a continuum.

I've long entertained the possibility with my own high school students that China's ""Humpty Dumpty"" *was* able to ""put itself together again"" after the almost 400-year Period of Disunity following the Han due in large part to the script, while *Europe's* ""Humpty Dumpty"" could *not*, and still hasn't, put itself together again since the collapse of the Western Roman Empire 1,500 years ago. Alphabetic scripts are ""tribal walls,"" not ""bridges,"" as Prof. Slingerland's illustration demonstrated. I can ""bark out Czech"" by phonetically sounding its alphabet, but not understand a single thing.(Another fascinating effect, to me, of China's system is that it became a ""social *wall* between elites with the leisure time--years and years--needed to memorize the thousands of characters necessary to become literate, and the farmers and artisans too busy working for a living to enter the ranks of the literate. Mao inherited a China with less than 20% literacy rate in 1949 as a result of this, arguably.A *third* and final effect, confirmed by my own two-month immersion at age 50 in learning to read and write simplified Chinese, is the *psychological* effect of mental focus and discipline inculcated through such study, *and* the fusion of mind and body required to train the hand to execute the minute strokes necessary to distinguish one character from another, or to simply achieve aesthetic style.**But that Mesopotamian comparison?** It came compliments of French Assyriologist Jean BottŽro, in his wonderful *Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning, and the Gods.* He points out in one chapter on writing that the Sumerians, too, started pictographically, but their system diverged onto a different path due to a situation China never faced: the arrival of an *equally or more dominant ""foreign"" tribe*: the Akkadians. The Akkadian spoken language was Semitic, while the original Sumerian was not.Since the Akkadians came to dominate the Sumerians, the latter were forced to use their script to adapt their pictographs to handle *the Semitic Akkadian names, concepts, and phonemes* on a level of importance rivaling that of their native words. If I read BottŽro correctly, the original pictographic roots of the Sumerian became obscured by the necessity of combining them with sound-components--much like Mandarin script does too, but without the added and fateful complication of representing sounds foreign to those of the original characters.All very muddled, I'm afraid--it's late--but I'm intrigued by this and other questions of Cuneiform/Mandarin script. The materials used to write--brush in China, wedge-shaped reed in Mesopotamia; silk, bronze, and bamboo in China, baked clay in Mesopotamia--also raise interesting questions.

The question is: can we study human thought while abstracting away genetics/environment from our theoretical framework? Doing so would seem to require adopting some form of social constructionism.Personally it seems that although genetic and environmental factors (such as hard-coded sex drive or the night and day cycle on earth) do influence human thought, the influence is mostly by way of influencing culture which then influences human thought. This is a mostly sequential causal pathway, with culture between genetics/environment and human thought. In this sense, culture is the 'operating system' upon which higher forms of human thought are constructed. Therefore, we might greatly simplify our discussions by adopting social constructivism and focusing only on culture, while still retaining much of the explanatory power of a model that involves the lower layers of complexity of genetics/environment.Adopting social constuctionism would be a practical choice, not a stance about what constitutes The Truth. After all, it's obvious that both culture and genetics/environment influence culture; however this does not imply that we should give equal weight to both in our framework for studying human thought. In many ways the *gene-culture co-evolution* stance seems natural to assume (because it is obviously true in a sense), but its marginal explanatory power over social constructionism is not large enough to justify the large increase in complexity it adds to our discussions and theories.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,858894,0,0,1413873656140,1.41387E+12,1,Response to Slingerland's dismissal of social constructivism,FALSE,['858894'],discussion

Worried about being lost, I carefully rehearsed my sentence 'Excuse me how do I get to the exhibition hall?' and approached a passer-by.

It was of course a very tense time in China with strong distrust of all foreigners being actively fomented by the authorities. Even the few exchange students at that time did not acknowledge their Chinese classmates if they saw them in the street because talking to a foreigner got you arrested.

(I'm not even remotely an educator, I'm only speaking as a student.)I think the cause of the personal learning bandwagon is from teachers seeing the results of students who already have that drive, for example, teenagers who code their own mobile apps. These are students who, through the Internet, have more opportunities than ever of pursuing their own interests online, and bringing that into the school or the local newspaper. And so the teachers think, ""How can we make more students like this?"" I don't know what people who are on the personal learning bandwagon are advocating, but making space for students to complete a (rigorous, supervised) project of their own, on any topic they want, I think is pretty cool. In this case, I think the actual learning of the subject matter is less important than creating the drive--the learning will come in time, as a result of that drive.Supplanting general education entirely sounds crazy to me, though, because it's such a foreign idea.Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

But I don't think it's likely that he's unaware of ""the Shoulders of Giants"" and all of that. He seems to be characterizing our Western view of traditional thought and individual creativity. Relevant clips from the lecture:> The idea of the importance of traditional forms for thinking properly is I think a little bit weirder to us. So we're very much believers in creative thought, especially in the modern West. What we value is people thinking on their own and thinking freely and coming up with ideas out of nowhere. So if you want to think about modern Western attitudes toward thinking, I think they're perfectly captured in the Apple slogan, ""think different,"" right?--Note that this describes popular culture today. It's his introductory frame.He then turns to the Enlightenment, and after quoting Descartes explicitly stating he is starting from scratch in his search for knowledge, adds:>There's very good reason for thinking this is a very stupid model of how we think. It ridiculously exaggerates the power of the individual human mind. We are cultural animals. We're social animals. Most of the way we think is shaped and properly shaped by our cultures and by things we've learned from the past. So this Enlightenment ideal I think is inaccurate. >And actually the Confucian model is a much more accurate picture of how the way in which we think is a result of the creative apprehension of traditional learning. So it's not passive. We're not just going to memorize stuff and not use it, not think about how it applies to our lives and we don't synthesize it. --Provocative stuff, for sure. But Descartes *did*, after declaring independence from traditional Christendom's worldview, *cogitate his way right back to its God*. This is pretty clear evidence that even when we try to ""think outside the box,"" we're fooling ourselves. Descartes *was* inaccurate in his claim that he was a ""free thinker.""

Its Legalist government burned Confucian texts (saving copies for the imperial library, mind you--they just saw totalitarianism as necessary while consolidating the Qin peace, arguably) and executed dissident scholars (traditionally told as ""burying them alive,"" though there's reason to doubt that detail).Qin was overthrown by Han in 200 bce. Han founder Liu Bang was said to have literally urinated on a Confucian's hat to show his disdain for these effete bookworms. It's hard to imagine how much lower the hopes could get for Confucianism than that. Maybe using the Analects as toilet paper? Oh, but that was invented only later in the Han!Anyway, Han Emperor Wu--reigned 141-89 bce--favored Confucianism as the Imperial ideology. A stupendous moment, apparently motivated as much by inner court politics--Wu needed a rival power base to offset a threatening Daoist faction, I believe--as by appreciation for Confucianism.Jesus died on a cross. Some messiah. Nero burned Christians as streetlamps generations later. Fed them to lions for fun, on and on. Roman elites laughed at and ridiculed Christian beliefs as a) ripoffs of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman cults, and b) a religion for slaves, old women, and illiterates.300 years later, Roman emperor Constantine needed a power base--particularly fighters in his army during a civil war--to offset powerful rivals. The large population of ""slaves, old women, and illiterates""--especially the slaves and illiterate males--proved useful for those needs. He favored Christianity.East and West, Confucianism and Christianity both see failed spiritualities triumph for political reasons.

The Scientific Revolution was the *prelude* to the Enlightenment, part of the same ""starting over"" rejection of the medieval Christian culture that framed my claim: Medieval Christian tradition was bankrupt, and the Renaissance started the ""trash it and start over"" counter-culture. Sci Rev and Enlightenment are just two further sub-headings under the ""Early Modern"" main heading.The Western Zhou, being instead exceedingly humanistic and rational, were traditions worth preserving, not trashing, as Confucius rightly appreciated. If the Mandate of Heaven, a ""Divine *Responsibility* of Kings"" ideology, is not clear (and very Voltaire-ish, I might add) political philosophy--and the sumptuary codes and ritual order not social and economic philosophy to boot--it's hard to imagine why not. And again, Kongzi wasn't unquestioning about them, as you claimed.So I suppose we're at the ""agree to disagree"" stage. If I patronize, it's only because your characterizations of the Western Zhou texts--not philosophy done in Western modes of discourse (but then, neither was much of Plato)--and of Confucius' relation to them seen in the *Analects*, seemed both wide of the mark and defensively indignant in response to Prof. Slingerland's claims--to the point of painting them as sensationalism instead of substantive.

After he gets drunk, he retires, without caring where he finds himself. >His surrounding walls are bare and tattered, and do not shelter him from wind and sun. His short jacket is torn and patched; his bamboo-basket and gourd [used for rice and soup bowls] are frequently empty. He feels unperturbed nonetheless. >He often writes to amuse himself and to express his feelings. He forgets all about gains and losses, and thus he finishes the span of his life.>The commendation says: ""Chien Lou [ancient hermit] has a saying: 'No grief at poverty and humbleness, no eagerness for riches and honors.'

If I recall correctly from my introductory philosophy class in college, this thread runs from the Epistles of St. Paul, through Augustine and to Martin Luther.The idea is that the letter of the law, by specifying what is prohibited, actually teaches people how to do prohibited things. And if a person obeys the law only because they wish to avoid the penalties that come from breaking the law, then they have in fact already internalised the prohibited act and are restraining themselves by exerting their ""cold"" cognitive control over their baser desires. However, if a person really believes in the spirit of the law, then they internalise that spirit and instinctively act in accordance with the spirit. Since the spirit also gave rise to the law, a believer automatically acts in accordance with the law.In the first scenario, obedience is the product of external coercion, while in the second, compliance is the result of one's own volition. In the former, penalties are essential to guarantee order, while in the latter the letter of the law itself becomes superfluous to people behaving well.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,2550130,1,0,1414322005297,1.41432E+12,0,Coercive Obedience to Law vs. Internalised Compliance with Law,FALSE,[],question

I have to admit though that I cannot estimate how much influence role models in the public really had on people's behaviour otherwise.But I can say something about my personal feeling (not opinion) that I have got once in a while, when seeing initiatives like for instance the ""ALS Ice Bucket Challenge"". While not knowing if I am right at all with that, I experience those activities as overly willing and somehow artificial, like when politicians on their election campaigns suddenly visit disaster regions to hug little babies and pose with shovels in front of the many cameras, even if of course there exists in fact some difference of intention.But unrelated to the ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" and politicians searching the cameras I know that many people exist who just are good to others and help as much as they can, without talking about it to anybody else or even mentioning their names. The good deed is kept between the people helping and the ones getting help.But you made me think about the aspect of spreading the word to make more people becoming helpers, too. Maybe in this context the next question would be about the definition of when a good deed really is a good deed. Is it of importance why somebody does help, or does it just matter THAT one is helping? And is somebody who helps out of him- or herself better than somebody who has to be motivated, inspired, convinced, or even (socially) pressed to do so?Different philosophies and/or religions have different answers to that question, I think.

I just started out trying to say that I think throughout the reading the dominant thread of thought is for this rigid adherence to ritual and that examples to the contrary are minor.  I digressed when I claimed you misinterpreted the 1.12 passage.  I still don't think we agree exactly on the meaning, but that is fine and I think you raise some valid points.  For example I do find the juxtaposition of rigidity w/ harmonious ease quite interesting.  I still read the passage, however that you need to stick rigidly to ritual and do it with harmonious ease.  As far as the overall feel of rigidity, perhaps this is due to different preconceived notions.  I came in with little knowledge of Confucian teaching and simply the notion that eastern philosophies were more fluid, less rigid in general.  So to read this I definitely am surprised at degree of rigidity.  When you say there is rigidity but want to explore that degree, to me it seems like a high degree.  I can see if you came in with the notion that it was rigid, then you could look at the examples you provide and say, ""it's not that rigid"".  So perhaps just differences in initial viewpoint.  To me it does seem more rigid when compared with Western culture, or at least more rigid than I would being willing to accept.

From the blurb, ''Originally published as the second volume of *The Tao of Painting*, this book is the first translation into English of the *Chieh Tzu Yuan Hua Chuan*, or *Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting*. Part I of the Manual (The Fundamentals of Painting, Book of Trees, Book of Rocks, Book of Jen-wu), first appeared in 1679. In 1701 the publisher reissued Part I and added Part II (Book of the Orchid, Book of the Bamboo, Book of the Plum, Book of the Chrysanthemum) and Part III (Book of Grasses, Insects, and Flowering Plants; Book of Feathers-and-Fur and Flowering Plants; and two books of additional examples). The great popularity of the Manual is attested by the more than twenty editions published in China in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The present volume is a facsimile, with translation, of the Shanghai edition of 1887-1888, the first lithographic edition and the one which provides superior examples of the brushwork, always a matter of primary concern in Chinese painting. There are over 400 examples of brushwork, ranging from the single stroke of a blade of grass or a flower petal to the composition of a tree, village, or mountain. These examples help not only to clarify the text but also to enunciate the principles and standards of the *tao* of painting and to demonstrate how the traditions were handed down from period to period.Mai-Mai Sze has provided an introduction, chronology, and a valuable appendix in which the basic terms of Chinese painting are analyzed and illustrated by means of their ideograms and, in many cases, the earlier pictograph forms. Born in China and educated in England, France, and the United States, Miss Sze is a writer and painter. Her paintings exhibited in London, Paris, New York, and in a large retrospective at the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, Massachusetts.''In Zhou tradition, perhaps reading this is somehow teacherless, traditionless self-directed learning? My experience of Chinese art is often tapestries and paintings found in Chinese restaurants but you really have to know what you're looking for when buying for investment. The arts of making paints, brushwork and such have dwindled given changes to lifestyle and pastimes.

Harnessing yourself to a plough might on occasion in Chinese (and other countries') histories have been forced upon one but it would hardly have been a strategy of choice, particularly in a culture where, for example, rice farming required a collective effort. Laozi suggests not using horses for war but doesn't suggest not using them at all. He seems to envisage a simple life, rather tailored to the intellectual seeking a quiet life free from both external and internally generated stress. The dense metaphors and paradoxes suggest the work is aimed at intellectuals. This surely argues as you suggest a need for a certain level of social organisation as implied also by the acceptance of the notion of a king.I'm not a north American and am perhaps a little more sceptical of the idea that modern society is tailored to individualism. Socialist and communist traditions argue against this model and, after all, individualists wouldn't get far if nobody built the roads. This of course is the inevitable argument against modern-day hippies, basically that they are free-loaders on a rich developed society.

So he really believes he is on a mission from tian.a supreme diety, tian-- heaven.  Heaven has sent him on a mission to revive the culture of the Zhou.Ó---Prof. Slingerland,  Mod 2.1, Confucius and the Analects.CouldnÕt possibly agree more strongly with this assessment of the Confucian mission.  What disappoints is how little time is spent on any of the MasterÕs more universal ethical statements in any of the modules.  For instance, Fingarette, in Confucius: The Secular as Sacred (New York, Harper Torchbooks, 1972), 53 Ð 54:Acts that are li are not just rote, formula conforming performances; they are subtle and intelligent acts exhibiting more or less sensitivity of context, more or less integrity in performance.É an act may be seen as more or less ren if we see how this person does it, and more specifically whether it reveals that he treats all persons involved as of ultimately equal dignity with himself by virtue of their participation along with him in li. This concept that all persons are of equal dignity, that they are always entitled to oneÕs very best, whether the recipients of these actions are appreciative or not, is one of ConfuciusÕ great innovations and requires emphasis.  As the Master states in Analects 12:2, ÒWhen in public, comport yourself as if you were receiving an important guest, and in your management of the common people, behave as if you were overseeing a great sacrifice.Õ Do not impose upon others what you yourself do not desire. In this way, you will encounter no resentment in your public or private life.Ó  Still later in Analects 15:24, the Master states, ÒIs it not Ôsympathetic understandingÕ (shu )? Do not impose upon others what you yourself do not desire.Ó  Here I think the English concept of empathy is meant by shu; the idea of being able to see and feel the actual circumstance of others and respond in a meaningful and appropriate fashion.  These concepts, I believe, were intended as a corrective for what he viewed as the moral problem confronting him and his followers:I should like to say a word about ConfuciusÕ image of moral evil.  In fact the description of these evil tendencies which impede the achievement of the good is strikingly similar to the diagnoses made by the prophets, wise men and philosophers in all the high civilizations of this period.  The unbridled pursuit of wealth, power, fame, sensual passion, arrogance and pride Ð these themes figure centrally as the source of Òthe difficulty.Ó Schwartz, The World of Thought in Ancient China (Cambridge, Harvard University Press,  1985), 83.These problems are still our problems; his answers to these problems are the source of much of his appeal for Non-Chinese readers everywhere.

Do you have any interesting related links?I've picked up some aspects with Shou Gua, that seem to link well with some western classical metaphors. Also Dante [marsh, mountain, et al.].I've seen that if you use a system of image pairs of the related key words, such as in Dante, it seems to add another syntax dimension.

A corpus linquistical collocation and concordance with keys words associated with trigrams, then computing them, seems often very much in line with the underlying narrative. What I am saying is that I am using the trigram pairs, as one would with Chinese art, but in literal analysis on symbolism, particularly in Homer and Pindar, as well as Dante.I've come to the conclusion, such is known, but possibly kept 'secret' such as by fraternal organisations [Kabbalah and so on].

After all, an omnipotent deity could theoretically create an ideal world in which everyone still gets to exercise their own free will, *and* nobody ever falls to or suffers at the hands of evil. That we don't exist in such a world implies it either is not possible, or that we are mistaken about omnibenevolence in some way and such a world would be less ideal that the one we already have. To look at the myriad evils that obviously plague our world and still believe *this* is as good as an omnipotent and omnibenevolent creator could possibly make it is thus a hard pill to swallow.  The same kind of problem comes up for both the Daoists and the Confucians, I think. If the Daoists are right and people are already perfectly good, naturally omnibenevolent you might say, then how could evil culture and evil people emerge at all? But if the Confucians are right and people are naturally coarse and prone to baser instincts, then how did the sage kings of old overcome their natural coarseness and just happen to stumble upon omnibenevolence without the benefit of a Zhou culture that preceded them?  Despite the cleverness of our qualifications, when faced absolute theological doctrines such as omnibenevolence or the perfection of Zhou culture, I think the only way to resolve any contradiction to our own perception is to resort to faith. At some point a true believe has to stop questioning the will of God, the emergence of the sage kings, or the ontological framework of the primitivists.

Still and indistinct, not still but indistinct, and this wording is very significant.  These lines lead one to realize that most of us, in our day to day existence, interact within and to our environment in a completely culturally conditioned fashion.  We see what we have been trained to see and nothing more.  Laozi instructs us to Òmanifest plainness. Embrace simplicity.Ó  Muller translates these lines as Òsee the origin and keep to the non-differentiated state.Ó  When one is made aware that what is being translated here as ÒsimplicityÓ is in fact our friend, unhewn wood or the uncarved block of wood, one can feel how the thought being presented is the Ònon-differentiated state.Ó  What is a non-differentiated state?  Here this state of consciousness is an awareness of Òthings, beingsÓ in a manner that is not mitigated or influenced by language, the wordless teaching.  This awareness is always still **and** indistinct because the consciousness is not busy trying to separate and label the individual components that make up the experience.  An awareness of, an appreciation for the thing, the being as it is in itself.  A tree (in keeping with the wood theme) is a Òtree,Ó but if all you see is a ÒtreeÓ then you do not see it at all.  Colin Tudge, noted botanist, writer and lover of trees wrote:ÉBut the essences of nature will not be pinned down easily.  In the end all definitions of nature are simply for convenience, helping us focus on the particular aspect that we happen to be thinking about at the time.  There is no phenomenon in all of natureÉthat does not take a variety of forms, and that cannot be looked at from an infinite number of angles and each angle gives rise to its own definitionÉ The way that we define natural things influences the way we treat them Ð whether we speak of wildflowers or of weeds, of Mrs. Tittlemouse or of vermin.

We discussed the problem of evil as an argument against the existence of an omniscient, omnibenevolent, omnipotent God.

People are born naturally. They begin as children and behave as such, more naturally and in wu-wei, until they develop the mechanisms for cognitive control. Problems occur within the environment, which make society more complicated, and places are created in society. The places in society give rise to more complex problems of unnaturalness, and so an ""unnatural (written)"" soteriological structure is needed to bring back naturalness. Basically I am positing a response of a causal nature, ""If we had not become unnatural, then we would not need a soteriological structure to discuss. The good of the structure tends to outweigh the unnaturalness in society."" The other response is constitutive; ""If the were no unnaturalness, we could not appreciate naturalness.""

I think another, pretty directly analogous, example is when you're arguing with someone. Yielding to them--considering their points seriously, understanding where they're coming from--opens up the discussion so you can then guide them to see where you're coming from and what you believe. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll be convinced, but it's a lot more productive than shouting at each other. In this sense, I think yielding is an underrated skill. How many people actually listen to each other when they argue?Somewhat of a digression:I practiced Taijiquan for a while (disclaimer: I'm awful at it--you need to practice it very seriously for a very long time before you can actually use it martially. In a sense, you have to achieve wu-wei in Taiji to even use it at all) and a lot of the motions and ideas behind it are similar--you collapse around the attack, so they only meet empty air. ""Re-directing"" is a term commonly used in talking about Taiji, but I think it's more about making empty space where the other person is trying to hit you (you're not actively shoving at the person's fist). That in itself is enough to put you in the position of strength for a counter.So I'm not sure if there is a conflict in being weak to be strong. I think maybe it's an issue of wording--in Taiji, you aren't being ""weak,"" just like when you consider someone else's point of view in an argument, you aren't being weak. Maybe ""in control"" and ""not in control"" is better? You do not control the other person's movements, but make room for them. In this way, you gain control. It's hard to say what I think of this without making the same crazy paradoxes that we're hearing in lecture hahaha. I think it's something you have to be shown and try yourself to get. Or maybe it's better to say, it's not that you gain control, but when you make room for an attack, your adversary loses control.Hee.

The student's question touches on core features of Mohist thought -- features that remain interesting in ethical reflection today, I think. One core point is that the Mohists don't exactly argue for promoting the benefit of the state, per se. They argue for promoting the benefit of ""all under heaven,"" and their examples of the sage-kings' deeds clearly indicate that ""all under heaven"" includes foreign tribes. This point reflections their universalism: right and wrong are determined by the consequences for everyone, not just us. A second core point is how the anti-war arguments reflect the Mohist conception of dao. As they see it, dao is a path that can be practiced and promulgated regularly and consistently by all. To them, isolated counterexamples don't rebut the argument that wars of conquest are contrary to a state's own interest. They think history shows that wars of conquest usually end badly for the aggressor. Even if there are a few exceptions, the general point stands. And how can we be sure we'll be one of the exceptions?The student's remark about civil war brings up another interesting point. Because of their notion of ""all under heaven,"" early Chinese political thinkers have only a vague, slippery conception of a sovereign state. In practice, political entities like ancient Qi and Lu acted as independent, sovereign city-states, each with its own network of subordinate cities and towns. But in principle, these states were parts of ""all under heaven,"" subordinate to the (powerless) Zhou emperor and to Heaven itself. So a war between them in some respects resembles a civil war, and a military offensive to punish an aggressor is partly like invading another country, but partly like a domestic police action. I have a survey of early Chinese just war theory here, if anyone is interested: http://cjfraser.net/site/uploads//2014/09/Fraser_JustWar_Sept2014_single.pdf",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5042487,,0,1415301602845,1.4153E+12,6,,,"['5519036', '2775274', '4921047', '5557776', '264979', '5503021']",

He explains by saying that by believing you are taking a sort of bet. The expected value of the outcome of the bet is equal to all the values of possible outcomes multiplied by the probability of the outcomes.

A quote attributed to Mozi from Wikipedia, ''What is the purpose of houses? It is to protect us from the wind and cold of winter, the heat and rain of summer, and to keep out robbers and thieves. Once these ends have been secured, that is all. Whatever does not contribute to these ends should be eliminated.'' -http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi (2014)   From this, I would entertain the thought that Mozi would yes, be in favour of surveillance. Specifically, I am not sure if he would classify Harvard classrooms as a house of learning or if surveillance, rather than aggressive warfare, promotes pacifism. Focusing on his view that large music ensembles are a waste of resources detracts from focusing on more applicable teachings that aren't today so wild and preposterous. I'm of the view that it isn't particularly a core concept that underpins his teachings that serves in detracting from his character and credibility.   I'm of the understanding from the discussion that he holds in his views a concept of ghosts of deceased persons and spirits? Would those against surveillance be of the same opinion regarding divination? I am unsure of its specifics with regards to Chinese astrology, though one discussion mentioned China advancing faster if it had focused on 'Western scientific principles' which I believe would detract from their traditional models of study. I do not think it unpossible that a convergence of ideas in future cannot happen not unlike the studies involving monks, states of meditation and various states of brain wave production monitored in laboratories. Peering into the crystal ball could be claimed as an invasion of privacy, I'm sure I've heard an old wives' tale of how one can percept when someone is concentrating on thinking about you.   I am curious as to whether Mozi had court wizards in his employ influencing his decisions. From the discussion, he would have standard punishments and additional punishments from the spirit world that today would be described as barbaric. My question is if he had shamans in contact with spirit and dream-worlds as described in this course who dealt punishments on his command?    ",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5342258,,0,1415512801757,1.41552E+12,0,,,[],

Well the nature of the tree as it is small is to grow, if it gets the chance. As it grows the tree is fine, but it will change the course of the river (that's what willows do). That might be great for things that want a river to slow down and change direction - but evil for things that want the river to run fast and stay in that direction. Change happens, like for people, we want change (the Desires of the Eye). Then the willow grows old and dies and could be turned into a beautiful bowl - artistic people will like that - so 'good'.

It works on the basis of metaphor.In modern society we have specialists in the main, not polymaths. Change Theory is central to the polymaths tool kit.Thus following the Classics, and fully understanding Change Theory, in theory one would optimise every given situation, which would give a geometric progression of good decisions, consolidation and leverage, where you or the organisation would grow steadily, and strongly with deep roots, and tall branches like a tree.We haven't been discussing Change Theory, but Confucius sends you there if you look. He sends people to the Classics.I suppose we don't discuss Change Theory because firstly not everyone gets it, and secondly those that get it, don't feel the need to tell everyone about it? I am not sure in this regard. Most likely because its an early summer, night situation. Or, eye square.I've made some posts related to it, especially the one on metaphor....You internalise the Classics and then, if you have do so correctly, you will have exceptionally powerful skills, especially management, but also perception.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1099483,,0,1416129507283,1.41613E+12,0,,,[],

Although different cultures have different moral codes, there are some universals, such as a ban on arbitrary assaults, protecting children.  But he thinks that we aren't, necessarily, naturally nice to strangers.  Whereas evolutionary psychology can explain kin selection and reciprocal altruism, it doesn't explain the extension of kindness to strangers.  To explain why we should do this, we may need to use reason.  So, to go back to Mozi, we don't 'naturally' feel like impartial caring; a consequentialist approach is needed.So, according to Bloom, sometimes empathy, for example, can lead us to an immoral act.  We will take action for one person who is close, or whose picture we see: and this may be at the expense of other people who are either more distant or who are anonymous as far as we are concerned.  Bloom therefore concludes that 'the existence of reason, of rational deliberation, makes moral progress possible.'See, for example:http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/20/the-baby-in-the-wellAt the moment, I'm just trying to keep an open mind!",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,2114195,,0,1416148101179,1.41615E+12,1,,,['2775274'],

I don't believe the different levels of capacities handicap our free will.  We all are responsible for our actions, whether they are good or bad, regardless of big or small capacities.  Everyone is held accountable for their actions - which, as I understand it, will be known in the next world.  According to Baha'u'llah, the latest in the line of Divine Teachers, speaking about what we can expect once we die and particularly the one with ""psychopath"" behavior:  ÒThe souls of the infidels [those not following the Way], however, shall Ñ and to this I bear witness Ñ when breathing their last be made aware of the good things that have escaped them, and shall bemoan their plight, and shall humble themselves before God. They shall continue doing so after the separation of their souls from their bodies.Ó Here is one writing about those who sincerely strive to purify their hearts and actions will experience at the moment of death:  ÒBlessed is the soul which, at the hour of its separation from the body, is sanctified from the vain imaginings of the peoples of the world. Such a soul liveth and moveth in accordance with the Will of its Creator, and entereth the all-highest Paradise. The Maids of Heaven, inmates of the loftiest mansions, will circle around it, and the Prophets of God and His chosen ones will seek its companionship. With them that soul will freely converse, and will recount unto them that which it hath been made to endure in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds.ÓAt the same time, those who sincerely strive to walk the Way should not judge those who are committing harmful acts because we don't know know what our own end will be:  ÒHe should forgive the sinful, and never despise his low estate, for none knoweth what his own end shall be. How often hath a sinner attained, at the hour of death, to the essence of faith, and, quaffing the immortal draught, hath taken his flight unto the Concourse on high! And how often hath a devout believer at the hour of his soulÕs ascension, been so changed as to fall into the nethermost fire!Ó  This really is serious - keeps us ever-so conscious.I understand that every single one of us will, in the end, be held responsible for our actions, whether we were conscious in this life of our behavior or not.  The aim in this life...is to become conscious.  If at the end of our life we have nothing but ""poor"" behavior - bad, harmful, terrible actions...then it's clear that we missed the boat - missed the true purpose of life, and that is a sad thing.  Yet, that is what it is.  Do we want people to miss the boat?  No.  There is really more to this question, much more.  It is a subject to study in itself.  This is a beginning of why we should, we must - pay attention to the many intuitions and signs and messages that we receive on a daily basis...to choose which way to go, to do the right thing in any given situation.  If we sincerely seek to know the right way, we will be guided to it.  Day after day, year after year - we are given infinite number of ""assistance"" to see and choose the right way or wrong way.  So many people ignore the plethora of instances of truth; or, the intuition, the heart has become so deadened in their heart...they are totally and absolutely lost.  They need help to see.  But wee are not responsible for whether they awaken and see.  We all need help to see. That is why we should be of service to each other - to care for each other, even those who appear very lost.

If he were, would he keep talking about Heaven? Professor Slingerland said in lecture 6.7 that 'the Zhuangzian sage is this perfected person that's supposed to get drunk on heaven.  And throughout the Zhuangzi you see this kind of connection between the spirit, and heaven, and release.  You have this thing that's endowed in you, this Heavenly force, and you need to surrender to it and if you can do that, you'll be in a state of wu wei.'  If you were an atheist, wouldn't you refer to human states of being, such as 'flow' (to use a modern term); not a Heavenly force?  I suppose it depends on your understanding of  'heaven', and according to the textbook, tian 'is more like the impersonal processes of nature in the writings of Zhuangzi and Xunxi . . .'  So in that case, perhaps you're right.(Professor Slingerland did refer back in lecture 4.5 to 'the disbelief of his [i.e. Mozi's] age' and a growing agnosticism amongst the elite, so there must be evidence for this.  However, when he refers to Confucius saying, 'Practice as if the spirits are present', I hadn't thought of this until the lecture as a sign of disbelief.  I think there are many people who say they believe in (the Christian) God, for example, but who don't necessarily have a direct experience of their deity.

Different forms animate the body and covey interactions between ourselves, others and the environment. Because it has yet to be measured with a piece of Òscientific apparatusÓ Qi does not exist although our vernacular and experience seem to belie its non existence. We describe our energy as being high or low and talk of being more comfortable in certain environments than in others. There are good vibrations and bad and we talk about certain people as lighting up or filling a room with their presence and having charisma. We don't deny having bonds or making connections with friends, family members, pets and loved ones.Fragments of pottery indicate that the Chinese have been interested in Qi for over 5000 years and oral tradition places the Daoists as being involved. While Laozi may be the first Daoists to go public and among the most famous, he was not the first.The primary apparatus used by the Daoists for their studies was their bodies and cognition which they investigated through meditation.  We like to demean meditators as contemplating their navels which may not be far from the truth in the case of Daoists.  The lower dantian, or hara in Japanese, is the location in the midst of the abdomen that controls the Qi that animates the physical body.

Pinker is a persuasive writer, and I'm sure that there is a genetic component to sexual relations (as there obviously is to sexual desire), but Pinker seemed to argue that the sexual strategies of our hunter/forager ancestors can be read through into contemporary life, and that this explains male promiscuity. I've often wondered how long the hunter/foragers can take the rap for how we are now, before we evolve away from them. Evolutionary biologists are apt to point out how slight a period of time settled agricultural societies have been with us compared to how long humans have been around, but I've always been sceptical about the strength of this argument. As I understand it Xunzi would argue that men, by consciously telling themselves that chaotic coveting of the neighbour's wife was not a good idea, could reach the point of not coveting.

Aristotle, being a likely case and point.Thus as westerners, perhaps we are restrained in a cognitive box, designed to restrain openness to the foundational concepts of understanding, by a group of people that arrived a few centuries late and more than a few dollars short. Such is the nature of our software, and the intentional esoteric aspects.Thus to apply our western labels must in itself produce a form of limitation on the true overall schematic and true nature of Chinese Thought.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1099483,0,0,1417769819606,1.41777E+12,2,Error - Our Own Ontology Imposed on Chinese Thought,FALSE,"['1099483', '264979']",discussion

Somehow stressing "" Rightness "" comes before the affection for Uncles and cousins. So I will be studying your material for a while.

Thanks for bringing it up. The definition we're adopting for the course does indeed encompass some things that we aren't used to thinking of as ""religion."" Marxism, sports, liberalism, vegetarianism...the list could go on and on. Just a refresher on our working definition: religion involves ontological or metaphysical claims that provide normative guidance and a soteriological strategy. According to Charles Taylor, these claims or systems need not involve gods.Philosophy and religion are for our purposes being considered the same thing because their distinction is largely a product of 18th century French Enlightenment thought. In response to zoeSA's post >> There could be three or four scholarly perspectives on the possible origins of religion (these do not include theological theories). First, there are sociological approaches (Durkheim, Rappaport) Ñ religion reflects social needs and produces societies by enabling cooperation. Second are the existential/motivational approaches (Marx, Freud) Ñ religion reflects our fears and helps us manage terror and uncertainty better than other ways of thinking. Third are the cognitive byproduct theories (Hume and many contemporary cognitive scientists) Ñ religion is a side-effect of several features of our evolved cognitive abilities, such as theory of mind, our ability to detect agency, and our tendency to anthopomorphize the world around us. Fourth is the cultural evolutionary synthesis (Norenzayan), which draws from the other three perspectives and seeks to understand how religious ideas spread and change in populations through cultural transmission.Keep in mind that each approach has its own philosophical assumptions and implications.If you are interested in this issue, check out Lecture 2, entitled ""Circumscription of the Topic,"" in William James's classic book *The Varieties of Religious Experience* (available for free online). What do other people think of the problem of defining religion? Isn't religious studies fascinating?  :)",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,4863854,,0,1413340879807,1.41334E+12,3,,,"['738580', '1305733', '892884']",

I was under the impression that this was not necessarily the case. Metaphysics, for example, aims to understand the nature of existence (am I right?). Will that knowledge save us? It could lead to an answer for salvation when used by someone else, but does the knowledge itself save us and is the philosopher working toward metaphysical answers necessarily participating in a religion? Are all philosophers motivated by salvation?I can much more easily accept a vin diagram of philosophy and religion that overlaps, but not one where philosophy is completely inside the religion circle.

I like this line from Bossy, who has been talking about the mass for the dead, and the idea of souls in purgatory being purged by fire.  'Meanwhile the common-sense view was that the souls of the dead would naturally be more or less where their bodies were, in the churchyard, and suffering rather from cold and wet than from excessive heat.' (Bossy, 'Christianity in the West 1400 Ð 1700', p. 30)  Duffy, however, argues that 'traditional religion' was not a system of superstitious folk beliefs; and writes that the cult of intercession for the dead [to lessen the time a soul spent in purgatory] could be seen 'as a means of prolonging the presence of the dead within the community of the living . . . ' (Duffy, 'The Stripping of the Altars- Traditional Religion in England 1400 - 1580' p.303)  In other words, whether  'official' doctrine or no, it seems that ways were found to maintain a relationship with the dead.  Perhaps, with the 'invention' of purgatory, there was not understood to be such a sharp divide between life and death.And I think the idea that the dead maintain the same kind, or at least some kind, of relationship is probably fairly widespread.  For one reason, we apparently tend to think of them Ð dead loved ones Ð in a similar way to how we think of those who are alive but absent.  See, for example, the work of Dr. K. Mitch Hodgehttp://mitchhodge.orgfree.com/publications.htmlMight this be the 'gene-inheritance' aspect, whereas different understandings of the after-life are part of 'cultural inheritance'?  Another cultural difference from the early Chinese understanding was the belief that those suffering in purgatory, the ordinary dead, were in need of the living.

I'm currently following an EdX course on Historical Relical Treasures and Culture China from TsinghuaX, and this week's topic was early Chinese astronomy. In this lecture, there was a mention of a Xishuipo Neolithic tomb where a similar dragon and tiger had been found. The corpse was buried with its head facing south, and to the east was a dragon (so on the left of the body, respectively), and to the west a tiger (so, right), both depicted in shells. Later research of this tomb pointed out that rather than being merely decorative, these animals were probably references to the astronomic system (more specifically, the east and west 'palace') used at that time. By placing shells, bones, three accompanying sacrificial burials and the animal images in a certain position they were able to reproduce the cosmos as they knew it then. Of course I might be completely wrong in thinking that rather than shamanistic decorations, these two animals might've been references to astronomy, but I just thought I'd repeat the information I'd gathered here because I thought it very coincidental that they're so similar, even if the positions are reversed (then again, the archaeologists that discovered the tomb were equally confused as to why the corpse was buried with its head towards the south, so maybe they were just terrible at placement :P). So, since I posted this as being a question, my question is: Is it possible that rather than being spirit animals, the tiger and dragon accompanying the Yangshao shaman are actually depictions of the eastern and western palace in astronomy?

The goal of improving students' skills is perversely affected by the ""carrot"" of good grades for things like ""honor roll"" and class rankings--valedictorian and so forth. Rather than instilling a drive in students to show current skills in order to identify areas needing growth, the grade carrot instead encourages them to do that unvirtuous thing called ""cheating."" And the stick doesn't deter this because it's so easy to cheat now.The same ""carrot"" of individual happiness (generally measured by material gain today) leads respectable adults to *calculate* whether breaking the law is a ""price of doing business"" when gains from tax evasion, fraud, and other antisocial behaviors outweigh the penalties of the stick.This points, to me, to the ultimate problems of virtue in the West. Our education of the young trains them, through its Institutional Model, to value skillful dishonesty, and grooms them to see adult success in similar terms.

My two cents:In 'Acceptance and Commitment Therapy' (ACT), a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy of the third generation (doesn't that sounds cool), that essentialy fuses cognitive therapy with mindfulness, awareness is seen as a background presence. Or using a metaphore, it is the chessboard holding the different (sometimes conflicting) pieces. However it is always just what it is, a chessboard, no matter if the white or black pieces win. Or a metaphore I came up with, awareness is like the television screen. It does not care wether there is a crappy Stalone movie on or a beautiful Mozart concert. It is just there. The funny thing is I have been reading about Buddhism a lot and practicing it, but I nowhere found a better description of 'Buddha nature' or 'Big Mind' (the background awareness) then in the book about ACT by Stephen Hayes 'Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy'. It eloquently describes the nature between language and suffering (with all sorts of excercises) and basically says you should give up the struggle to get what you want: in this case mental health, sounds a lot like trying not to try :)Anyway the link between the above and hot/cold cognition is not clear but I thought it would add to the discussion.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5454422,,0,1413836664480,1.41384E+12,0,,,[],

When leaving out unfortunately still clearly existing problems of prejudices, xenophobia, racism and antisemitism or other similar isms, all those people should get along well with each other as long as everybody follows the common rules (i.e. laws, accepted behaviours, duties etc.) of society.Though, when Confucianism can be seen as a religion, Confucius' opposition today might rather aim on the lack of proper religious ritual, like Ð if he were a Westerner and a Christian Ð for instance in previously Christian cultures, when people do not pray each day and join the evening service or the Sunday Mass, to ""be on good terms with God"" (This is not my belief so please excuse me for simplifying here).I come to this conclusion because, when I understand it correctly, it was the fact of the Zhou practices not being followed any longer in the right way (minor aristocrats doing what only the rightful king is allowed to do) that the Heaven somehow assigned Confucius to go on his mission to change the overall situation.

So, for Module 1, you should read all three excerpts from *Trying Not to Try* before watching videos 1 - 5, and and the excerpts from *The Book of Odes* and *The Book of Documents* before watching videos 6 - 9. For Module 2, you should read through all of the Required Reading after watching the introduction video, but before watching the main lectures.We have not matched page numbers from the Required Readings to specific lectures, as you requested. However, as we move forward, you will find that Prof. Slingerland always cites the book and passage number of the quotes that he refers to. Therefore, as you watch the lectures, you may find it helpful to occasionally pause the video, and find the full passage he is talking about in the Required Readings.Finally, each lecture *does* contain specific additional readings listed in the Further Readings section. For example, the Further Readings for Module 2, Lecture 2 can be found [here][1]. You can use these to do your own research about any topic that you found particularly interesting. Beneath many of these Further Readings, you will see short descriptions, which will help you know what part of the lecture they're about.Hope this helps!Robin  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/UBCx/China300x/3T2014/courseware/108e3b942b2b4fd98caf4cb2151733c5/14d0d7efa8f240aeb638c98401debf0f/",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5253117,,0,1413940753379,1.41394E+12,0,,,[],

The rituals *are* communal at heart--and even the invitation to the ancestors to come and enjoy the food, wine, music, dance, and family togetherness serves the pro-social function of *expanding the sense of family beyond the living/dead divide,* and embedding the living in a much vaster canvas of secular time. Now picture an atheist in a Christian country (or any Abrahamic one, possibly), saying, ""I don't believe in God, Jesus, the Resurrection, or Salvation--but it's *essential* that we keep going to church to perform the Mass and observe the Liturgical Calendar."" Since the ritual here connects *not* human to humans, but one individual human soul to the Trinity and Eternal Heaven, it *doesn't* make sense to me, and couldn't serve, the way Kongzi's rituals did, to civilize a declining society.This is one of the most relevant aspects of Confucianism to our times, for me.

Of *course* the Enlightenment said ""trash it all and let's start from scratch--with a bit of Platonism and Aristotelianism thrown in.""Before turning to Kongzi's inherited tradition, let's review your characterization of it:> Confucius deliberately narrows his learning to arbitrarily-chosen texts from a past dynasty without troubling about their morality or veracity. He is specifically looking for an unquestionable model, which leads me to wonder whether his interest is more political than philosophical. Any reader of the *The Book of Documents* knows it is political philosophy of the first order, by no means ""arbitrary,"" and of astonishingly impressive morality--especially given that it was contemporary with the far less ethical and historically verifiable *Hebrew Bible.* Only a grounding in its political *and cultural* views--particularly on *music*--can open on how non-""arbitrary"" the *Book of Odes* was as a second anchor to civilizing culture.If you open yourself to reading those two works (and also notice that Kongzi by no means took an ""unquestioning"" stance toward them, as a careful read of the *Analects* clearly demonstrates), you should find it easier to entertain the idea that Kongzi's tradition deserved the opposite of the trashing so deserved by medieval Christendom; it deserved nothing short of defense and revival.His interest was not ""*more* political than philosophical."" It was both, and more, equally. The political model of Yao, Shun and Yu, and of Wen, Wu, and the Duke, encompassed good governance, healthy ethics, justice, refined culture. It's far more rational than you seem to understand. (And the Enlightenment, by the way, was very, very influenced by Jesuit and Dominican reports of China's political system and its Confucianism.

It's the extremists--who do exist with increasing frequency--who scare me.I agree to your view of a blend, with guidance and rigor, and balanced with the traditional ""pastoral"" confidence that we adults should expose youths with certain fields of knowledge and understanding regardless of their personal preferences (my principal called ""not knowing what you don't know"" ""second-level ignorance,"" which I liked, and which applies here).I think the dilemma involves the erosion of any traditional ""core curriculum"" that comes as the ""opportunity cost"" of personalized learning. Whatever non-traditional learning is added requires the removal of part of that ""core.""But to add to the irony, our ""core"" is so ""vessel""-oriented--""become a tool for some job so you can make money doing something you don't love""--that it's of questionable value in cultivating efficacious adults in the first place. Homo Economicus and character education are two very different things.But again, the ""learning by doing"" example you give with your coding course is well-taken.

Very complex stuff, and I'm groggy from an all-night study session, but shorthand:Individualism is surprisingly strong in Confucianism and Daoism. This comes clearer when the individual's creative relation to the traditions (think calligraphy, poetry, opera, etiquette, music) is encountered in the traditional writings. The Tea Ceremony host is another great example: *within* the traditional role is a vast range of individual expressive freedom--""creativity."" Ditto calligraphy. TS Eliot wrote an essay called ""Tradition and the Individual Talent"" that I've entirely forgotten in my decades since reading it in college, but now want to return to in this context.Tolerance in Confucian East Asia is also--especially in religious terms--far stronger than in monotheistic cultures. Outside of revolutionary millennarian cults rising in China's history with rebellions that provoked military responses, Confucianism and Daoism show no tendency toward the religious warfare that the West has seen from Joshua's Biblical times to the Crusades of Medieval (and, some would argue, contemporary) times. Tibet and Xinjiang, some will counter. I'd rebut that these are domestic political challenges--separatist movements that any government would resist (cf. American Civil War)--and not religious intolerance. Individual freedom of speech and expression? *Less* tolerated in today's China (and Singapore and Korea), but *far more* tolerated than the Western media suggests. Complaints against the government are common in Chinese social media. Calls for its overthrow or the end of the one-party system, being (reasonably, in my most charitable moods) interpreted as ""treason,"" are not tolerated. But that takes us to questions of politics and national sovereignty.And I would rather live in a society that did not allow Mikki Anaj or whatever her name is to pollute our children with songs like ""Anaconda."" That's the Confucian in me. Culture *does* shape society, so an individual's freedom to fill it with degeneracy is not a simple matter to me.

Some cultures still adhere to strict forms of dress probably for similar reasons and are viewed negatively if cultural norms are not observed. I would just like to reflect that western dress in particular has become so varied and stretched so many boundaries that it mostly no longer communicates a norm. I don't advocate uniform dress but we have lost a powerful tool which once communicated a lot about a person eg judges, lawyers, doctors used to dress appropriate to their roles in some cases but hardly do today. It is more far reaching in that many of us favour unisex clothing of tops and trousers (jeans), 'outlandish' clothing is more acceptable, and so on. There are hardly any norms any more.

Prof. Slingerland had elaborated further that one can ""become Chinese"" by acquiring ""Chineseness"", by internalizing its culture and practising it. The Javanese has similar views: they see their values and code of conducts as THE proper way of being cultured, being proper human being. The Javanese had a saying that foreigner or even a Javanese child who is not acculturated enough in Javanese way be called ""durung njawani"", literally meaning ""had not yet Javanese"". And they use that term ""njawani"" or ""being Javanese"" referring to generally ""cultured people"". So everybody had chance to being Javanese, such as German jesuit priest [Franz-Magnis Suseno][1] who became Indonesian citizen and studied and practised Javanese culture deep enough that the Javanese people themselves had fully accepted him as a Javanese person. And, although a bit trivial (but might be important), I found similar tendencies in how the Chinese and the Javanese usurped foreign vocabularies into their language, not just merely loan-words. One could say that the words are being ""Chinesized"" or ""Javanisized"" (sorry, this is an entirely made up words of my own perhaps).Now I'm wondering how cultural interaction between Java and China had actually been. It is known that Chinese merchants (and influences?) had been present in Java since at least 600-800 CE, but there's no record of their direct influences, and instead, we Javanese more often linked our roots back to Hinduism, and earlier, Buddhism.

Did the Enlightenment abandon Copernicus and Galileo or the Renaissance? One can make a case that Descartes' cogito was the introduction of subjectivism into philosophy and argue that that was a negative development, but he does not by himself represent the Enlightenment and its consequences.You instruct me, a little patronisingly I felt, to open myself to the Book of Documents and the Book of Odes, and assert that 'Any reader of the Book of Documents knows it is political philosophy of the first order..'. Plainly it is vitally important and fascinating source material about early China and a gold-mine for scholars, but we do not know why it was written or, in the case of parts of it, when, and to describe it as political philosophy seems to me to be stretching a point. Its adoption by Confucius and other philosophers has often meant it has been incorporated into their philosophies, but the very fact that they can disagree about it suggests to me that it itself does not offer a coherent philosophy. As far as the Book of Odes is concerned it is equally fascinating as a source, and contains some beautiful poems, but I cannot see it as necessarily iconic - were no worthy poems being written  or collected after the Western Zhou? Of course there were. This is my difficulty with Confucius - he is didactic rather than forensic and tends to be dismissive of everything he cannot locate in the Western Zhou. I acknowledge of course that we have comparable difficulty with sources about Confucius as we do with earlier texts. I'm sorry you think I don't understand the political wisdom of Yao and the rest, but I shall continue to regard them, whatever their historical existence may have been, as the products of China's philosophical tradition not its progenitors. I don't have any major problems with anything Professor Slingerland said.

Although I'm probably wrong I hope that my point of view may help to understand this concept, if not with my argument, at least with a discusion.In the video ÒrenÓ is described as a innate harmony among the different virtues, or like a kind of internal joy. Although I think these interpretations go in the right direction, in my opinion, they are incomplete.I think that ""ren"" is the hot version of cold logic and I think that I can support this claim on three reasons:First Confucius makes special emphasis on thinking when you are learning, to avoid a simple memorization of the rituals. In my opinion this leads thowards a search for a logical structure and coherence among all learned material. In the case of rituals, this can only be archived through a perception of the emotions involved in it, because, otherwise, it would look pretty ridiculous and make not logical sense at all. So, through this concius acknowledgment of emotions, a link between the cold and hot parts of the brain is stablished.Second, as I see it, this process not only will lead to an explicit internalization of virtues, but also to an implicit internalization of reason and logic. Therefore the total result will not only be a spontanius correct behavior, but also, when confronted with new situations, a quicker process of internalization; until a point when the internalization happens also spontaniusly. This spontaius correct intuition will be percive as an extrange order within the external world, because the concius mind will not be abble to pinpoint the exact line of reasoning. At this point the reward for reflecting on the self will move from an external one, the desire of acquire social skills, to an internal one, trying to understand this extrange order within the external world, and this conects with my third reason.My third reason is that Confucius phylosophy has as ultimate goal to adquire ÒrenÓ. However this concept is presented as vage and mysterius, almost magical. I think that this is done intentionally in order to guide the apprentice toward this concept when confronted with the Òstrange order of the worldÓ. This will help him to see that, in reality, is a Òstrange order within himselfÓ and how he adquired it. At this time he will be abble to beging to **explicitly** internalize reason and logic, or adquire ÒrenÓ. Although Confucius did not write about how this can be done in his lesons, he said:""I will not open the door for a mind that is not already striving to understand,nor will I provide words to a tongue that is not already struggling to speak.**If I hold up one corner of a problem, and the student cannot come back to mewith the other three, I will not attempt to instruct him again.**""",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1112518,0,0,1414069183682,1.41407E+12,0,"Concerning the concept of ""ren""",FALSE,[],discussion

The Master said, ÒDo not decline it! [If you do not need it yourself], could you not use it to aid the households in your neighborhood?Ó>Most commentators explain that the disciple Yuan Si was appointed to be steward of ConfuciusÕ household while Confucius was serving as Minister of Justice in Lu. Again, this is probably not historically accurate, and it is more likely that Yuan SiÕs employer is one of the Three Families. Some commentators see the point of this passage to be simply that, once one has accepted a position, it is improper to decline the salary that goes along with it, but there is probably a bit more to it than that.>Reading this passage together as a partner to 6.4, and seeing it in light of the many injunctions against seeking office for the sake of material benefit found in ConfuciusÕ teachings, the disciple Yuan Si no doubt expected to be praised by the Master for declining to be paid a salary.>The point of ConfuciusÕ response is that the proper course of action cannot be determined by a simple formula, but should be the result of careful reflection and consideration of the needs of others.>Based on Yuan SiÕs one other appearance in 14.1, as well as later legends that sprung up around him, he seems to have been one of the excessively ÒfastidiousÓ (juan ) who Confucius complains about in 13.21: his obsession with remaining unsullied prevents him from effectively engaging with the world.>-what strikes me here is the flexibility of the Master. The way can't simply be reduced to an easy formula. We have think and feel what is the best course in any situation.And Belgian Sinologist Simon Leys also pushes back on the ""rigid"" stereotype in the ""Introduction"" to his translation of the *Analects*:> modernity of Confucius is an aspect which, paradoxically, non-Chinese readers may perhaps be in a better position to appreciate. The only advantage that can be derived from our condition of ignorant foreigners is precisely the possibility to look with a kind of unbiased innocence at this book--as if it were all fresh and new. Such innocence is denied to native readers. For them, the Analects is [a mere] Òclassic"" (xvi- xvii)....>Over the centuries, the official Confucian cult has created a conventional image of the Master, and as a result, many people have tended to imagine him as a solemn old preacher, always proper, a bit pompous, slightly boring--one of these men who Òpush moderation too far.Ó In refreshing contrast with these common stereotypes, the Analects reveals a living Confucius that constantly surprises (p. xviii).Those surprises come most easily when reading scholars such as Robert Eno, Roger Ames, PJ Ivanhoe, Henry Rosemont, Jr., and our own Dr. Slingerland. They've looked at Kongzi for decades, and have so much to show us.

Contemplating the lecturer's example of the Apple slogan I mused on the number of advertisements we see that urge us in just this way to demonstrate our individuality by buying the mass-produced article which all our peers are also buying. Are all the admen closet Confucianists seeking to insert their products into our 'hot' cognition?Nothing against Apple of course - I couldn't do the course without them!

I'm afraid I can't reciprocate as my knowledge of China's early history comes from generalised sources, most recently a history by J.A.G.Roberts and the Cambridge Encyclopedia of China.I'm not sure we know enough of the history to know why the Western Zhou fell but, not being a believer myself in the Mandate theory to explain the demise of dynasties, I'm content to think it was likely to have been overthrown by external forces, Like you I see no point in criticising the Zhou for being expansionist, but regimes which extended themselves in the north-west were always vulnerable to a combination of nomadic invaders and dissident Chinese rivals. Pines' thesis that the Zhou emphasis on kinship ties (which according to Roberts is supported by burial practices) suggests that the Zhou may have needed or wanted to protect the interests of a wider swathe of society than just the royal family, but I find it a bit of a jump from there to calling them humanistic.Mencius of course is part of the idealisation of the Western Zhou after the event as is Confucius. I guess we can't know how much of Confucius view was evidential some two hundred years after the fall, but I suppose it ultimately doesn't matter in the light of the fact that the view of the Western Zhou as a golden age became a fact just because so many accepted it. As far as the role of popular welfare as a measure of good government is concerned, it is perhaps a truism that regimes which negatively affect popular welfare anywhere in the world ran into trouble and the history of peasant revolt in China demonstrates this to have been true in China. Confucius seems to recognise this but whether it topped his list of requirements for a ruler is a bit unclear to me. Mao of course would have put the Zhou in the category of feudal rulers who by definition didn't care enough. I wouldn't call Confucius a gullible romantic, but he may still have attached his own ideals onto a convenient hook.  ",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,2824718,,0,1414226274204,1.41423E+12,0,,,[],

It would seem that the Confucian framework does include leeway for people to employ different means to achieve the ""junzi"" state and Goodness.  Indeed, it seems to me that people in a state of Goodness would naturally just behave in line with ritual, and they would do this without feeling that the ritual requirements are a burden.The way that Prof. Slingerland differentiates between conservative and modern cultures also strikes me as a bit strange.  I would have thought that what differentiates a conservative culture from a modern one is not that the former emphasises the dominance of a single cultural pattern while the latter values difference, but rather that the former emphasises cultural patterns from the past while the latter values newness in cultural patterns.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,2550130,,0,1414231856650,1.41423E+12,0,,,[],

One finding? Heroes tend not to over-think it:>>In a study out last week in the journal PLOS ONE, Yale researchers recruited more than 300 volunteers to read statements by 51 contemporary Òheroes.Ó These men and women had all received the Carnegie Hero Medal for Òcivilians who risk their lives to save strangersÓ; the experimenters wanted to know whether they had acted without thinking or after exerting Òconscious self-controlÓ in order Òto override negative emotions like fear.Ó>>The volunteersÑand a computer algorithm, for safesiesÑanalyzed the medal winnersÕ statements for evidence of careful thought, or of unpremeditated action. Overwhelmingly, they found that day-savers rescue first and reflect second. As Christine Marty, a 21-year-old student who wrested a trapped senior citizen from her car during a flash flood, said, ÒIÕm thankful I was able to act and not think about it.Ó Study author David Rand noted that people playing economic games are similarly less likely to share resources when they ruminate about their moves, but more generous when they donÕt take time to consider strategy.>Waldman goes on to note previous studies that shed light on the thoughts of altruistic risk-takers:>>In 2005, researchers ran personality tests on 80 Gentiles who risked their lives to shelter Jewish refugees during the Holocaust, as well as 73 bystanders. Two interesting commonalities arose among the ÒheroesÓ: First, they were more likely to embrace, or at least tolerate, danger. Second, they were more likely to say they interacted frequently with friends and family. These findings expanded on a classic 1970 study of 37 Holocaust rescuers, in which researchers determined that the helping Gentiles were animated in part by Òa spirit of adventurousness.Ó (Related but more prosaic: Studies suggest that Òsensation-seekingÓ is positively correlated with the willingness to give blood.) In 1984, scientists John P. Wilson and Richard Petruska determined that Òhigh-esteemÓ college studentsÑthose who believed they were worthy and competentÑmore often rushed to aid an experimenter during a simulated explosion, while Òhigh-safetyÓ students, driven by a need for security and the desire to avoid anxiety, were less likely to lend a hand. In the realm of smaller, but still substantial, risk, 74 percent of kidney donors interviewed for a 1977 study said they put great faith and trust in people, compared with only 43 percent of non-donors.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,2716837,0,0,1414240443701,1.41424E+12,1,"Psychology of Heroes (Study), Hot/Cold, and non-WEIRD Communalism",FALSE,['4921047'],discussion

The European Enlightenment came from the discovery of ancient texts (maintained for centuries in Middle Eastern libraries) that called into question the rigid dogma and excessive punitive policies of the Roman Catholic Church. Of course people had to start thinking for themselves, as well as learning from other models. But the Enlightenment also led to excesses, such as splitting the soul/mind and body, and the birth of reductionist science which in turn led to the Industrial Revolution and now to the destruction of much of the natural world and rampant inequality in the human world.Confucius, on the other hand, was writing in the time of the Warring States, where there must have been plenty of impulsive actions without regard to the lessons that leaders might have learnt from past leaders. Today we have something similar, with 'The new World Order' declared by the US collapsing all around us as another kind of warring states cause havoc. Even though I was in favour of progressive learning and teaching throughout my career as a teacher (and don't regret or forswear this), I look back on my study of the classics at school and University as the foundation of my current thinking.As for the woman question, it seems to me that Confucius was concerned with learning and thinking in ***public life*** rather than in private life, and since public positions were then filled by men, I think it is quite fitting that he doesn't see himself as providing paragon models from which women could learn to think.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,3509553,,0,1414395923588,1.4144E+12,0,,,[],

In early Confucianism, Heaven (*tian*) granted *de* to a ruler when he sincerely applied his mind and actions to following the Way, as discovered and practiced by the ancient Zhou kings. Having brought his mind perfectly in line with the Way, he was also able to act in a state of *wu-wei*, effortlessly achieving good results all around him. Was the source of his success ultimately *de* or *wu-wei*? Perhaps we might simply say that his power stemmed from his *de*, but he acted in *wu-wei*. They go hand-in-hand.

For example: tea ceremony, weddings, funerals, or in temples and in traditional martial art schools. So, or the Chinese lost it over time and are doing these rituals more pragmatic, freestyle (and that's a new cultural aspect), or they always already have had their own way of doing rituals (this freestyle way) and that differs culturally from Japanese?

In DDJ42 it explains that the Dao births One, One Births Two, Two Births Three and the Three birth Everything (10,000 things/Wanwu). Why is this important? Well, Yin and Yang aren't absolutes, there are just two ideas to express things. DDJ2 explains how there can only be beauty if ugliness exists, but by those two existing it allows all the possibilities of the beauty-ugly spectrum to exist. With your idea of the circle, and the image that is used to represent the Dao (Taiji tu), there exists Yin within Yang and Yang within Yin, which shows they aren't absolute and opposite pairs, but rather have each other within them. DDJ42 can also be used as a metaphor for human life, as Two gives birth to a third, which is Yang (Man) and Yin (female) gives birth to a third (child). In the Huainanzi Ch 5 it explains why 3 is an important number, 3x3 = 9 and 9x9 = 81. A fair few other important texts in the Lao-Huang have 81 chapters too.Just a different perspective.

The other senses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own, and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man, and all the instruments and books of the earth, and all reasoning. What is marvellous? what is unlikely? what is impossible or baseless or vague--after you have once just open'd the space of a peach-pit, and given audience to far and near, and to the sunset, and had all things enter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without confusion or jostling or jam.....Walt Whitman, Preface, Leaves of Grass.  1855.This concept has nothing to do with faith; using St. PaulÕs definition: faith is the substance of things unseen.  No, what we are discussing is a matter of praxis, not belief.  It is all about things seen and about the manner in which something is seen.Regarding your second point; are we Òmeant toÓ seek such understanding?  You, yourself, have already answered this question with an affirmative answer with the examples you have listed above.  To answer further with regard to the praxis under discussion; many ÒspiritualÓ traditions suggest the use of various disciplines that use imaginal focus.  This is not imaginary, rather it uses a specific be-ing as a centering image that allows the individual to slowly, and with practice more rapidly, shift their concentration from the self into the awareness of the other.  The other becomes oneÕs center allowing a new awareness to be birthed.  This is not perception, rather it is a meta-conscious awareness that has no verbal component.  This experience of seeing beyond with its movement into a deep moment of life mindfulness is deep sensory awareness and memory.As an example I will relate an experience of this from my early childhood (age three to seven).  A tree (again this simple image) grew at the edge of my familyÕs front-yard. It was a young pine, Scotch pine to be specific.  It was young enough (its first branches, low to the ground) but strong enough to be the perfect climbing tree.  I would spend hours in this tree, much to my motherÕs dismay and displeasure, for I would frequently come down with pine pitch covering my hands and on my clothes, but she would never scold me for this consequence.  I would perch myself for hours it its topmost branches and sail away to my other home, not a better/superior home, just other.  My favorite days for this sailing were the windiest ones; I would rest in my trees embrace, secure in my perch as a result of this treeÕs growth pattern (four branches growing out from the center, two of which I looped my legs around, one providing my seat and the other the focus for directionality) and I would just sail.  I would feel the wind against my face and hands but also deeply through the trees own movement. This movement would guide me home; accompanied with the trees own voice in concert with the wind through its needles, everything from the softest of whisperÕs to  intense clamorous shouting and we, together, would fly.  This Home was a safe, constant, shifting moment alive to and with every movement of natureÕs breath.  In late autumn when it was the coolest during which my mother would still allow my ascent, she would have to come and claim me from this other home when she was worried for my wellbeing.  I would descend with my own expressed displeasure at this interruption of my journeying, my hands and face red, my fingertips and lips blue but with only the felt experience of my trees shared warmth.During my seventh summer the townÕs planning commission decided our road required widening for greater ease of traffic flow.  Per this plan, My Tree was to be removed.  My grandfather, a town supervisor, was placed in charge of this project.  I begged him to alter the roadÕs course to spare MY TREE, I pled with him, I sobbed and wept to no avail.  The day my tree was ripped from the earth, murdered, I watched silently, shedding tears for her death. For days afterward I would speak to no one.  For weeks longer I would not speak to my grandfather, not even when I was punished for my disrespect of not answering his direct questions.  After one such punishment, sitting alone, crying.  I suddenly had a sense of complete joy and wonderment descend over me: I was suddenly flying with MY TREE again.  I realized that she could not be taken from me, and oh the bliss.  I have never lost that joy nor that way of seeing beyond. ",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5515444,,0,1414863695233,1.41486E+12,0,,,[],

Everyone and everything, all plants, animals and inanimate objects are nothing more than the earth breathing us out and in. Whoosh - we are here; whoosh, we are not. We enter existence on the out breath; and retreat to non-existence on the in breath. This vast and eternal process of coming into being and then moving into non-being, this taking and losing of shape and form, is impermanence. Once we know how small our bodies are compared to the enormity of the whole process we begin to realize what is actually going on here. On the one hand, impermanence is terrifying. There is nothing to grasp, everything will be lost.  On the other hand it is beautiful. Suffering will pass, like everything else. Once we fully realize impermanence in this way, we can settle into life as it is and realize that the surface of our lives, the particulars, are but a vehicle to express this profound fundamental reality. In this way we come to accept our conditions, as they are, and can reach the ineffable depth of life. That is, ""This is my life, I can embrace everything in my life.

ManifestoSection I  Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own, and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man, and all the instruments and books of the earth, and all reasoning. What is marvellous? what is unlikely? what is impossible or baseless or vague--after you have once just open'd the space of a peach-pit, and given audience to far and near, and to the sunset, and had all things enter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without confusion or jostling or jam?.....Walt Whitman, Preface, Leaves of Grass.  1855.The Earth calls out to her friends.  She cries, screams, shrieks, yelps, hollers loudly for friends to feel her/their mutual need.  Her course is our course and her pulse is fiercely felt, forcing her now into us.  Her hold is complete; no leap of body, mind or soul ever escapes her embraceÉthe whisper of her searching sighs insinuates, plies her caressing kiss, penetrating skin and heart and blood and brain to beingÕs very center moment.  Our being always replies through its own sensing song but seldom, and then but by a few, is the sensed sigh, caress, celebrated in joyous consentience.  Her companions quake to behold her beautyÕs constant munificence.  Mere knowledge cannot comprise the quick gift of this congruent consciousness nor hold the heart of it. The intuited intention tendered in these crying, pulsing, penetrating, searching sighs push her intimates toward deeply felt, careful, conscious engagement.  Engaging the shared being of her fellow few, her now embodies the only path that can be taken home.  For home welcomes all, wearied, wondering, wandering toward the common, only end.  This engagement contends:         Ahimsa; nonviolence is the only mode for livingÉviolence against any is violence against all and against the earth.  Violence in all its forms and practices must be eschewed.  Life is sacred; to act against life denies the common source of all. The pulse is a measure of remembrance; now and now and now is all, no more.   State violence or threat of violence demeans the common existence of all its members; that the individual member must not harm, maim or kill any other but that collectively such acts are enjoined for the preservation of all its membersÕ wellbeing is an obvious contradiction that should require no further elaboration.  Economic violence is the daily continuous violence committed by the wealthy few against the rest.  Their amassed wealth is theirs because they insist soÉ it is regarded by a widely feared authority known as the IRS as unearned and is listed as such on tax returns.  If unearned, how does this alienated wealth belong to this few?  The modes and structures of production and service generate this violence and continue to intensify this violence by their persistence.  Their persistence continues only as a consequence of the laws and conventions that are maintained by the violence or threat of violence that the state insists it has as a right to and from itself.Environmental violence is a direct consequence of economic violence; the few in their largely unhampered drive to amass more wealth refuse to consider or be responsible for the harm their greed does to others and the earth.  Their mechanisms of production belch out toxins into the air, pour out poisons into rivers and streams, devour whole forests and degrade the very soil.  Any attempt to constrain their greed or mitigate their destructive practices is met with shrieks of unfair redistributionism and cries of too costly for sound business practice.  Unfair, for whom?  Too costly, when the continued sustainability of life on this globe is threatened? When the state and the oligarchs collude, disaster for the commons ensues.  The disaster is not theirs alone: the few depend upon the many for so much.  This relationship disturbs the few and they seek ways to escape.  This fantastic denial of their familial need for others to succeed drives their ever greater dependence on resources to insulate themselves from the others they fear.  This fear fuels the fewÕs fervent refusal to acknowledge their own dreaded commonality: their hungers, needs, desires are superior and must be granted their due priority (they, the few, insist).  Their attempts to isolate themselves behind walls of unbreachable security, requires the commitment of an ever increasing accumulation of ruthlessly extorted reserve resources that they feel compelled to hoard as their shield against the many.  This disaster becomes catastrophe when the blinkered state assumes the priorities of the few as just and blindly enforces the privilege of the few as rule of law.  The weight of law becomes the crushing blow of violence as more and more of the many reject the justice met out by the state on behalf of the few and the state is obliged to brutally enforce the letter of the law, suddenly, writ large in the blood of the many pouring through the streets and sluicing into culverts, ditches and gutters.The ruthlessly extorted resources required by the few are obtained by any unfair means of acquisition that can by conceived of by the minds of Òlegal expertsÓ retained by the few for this specific purpose.  These doyens of determined desire willfully delineate as correct, reasonable and ethical any means of procurement for the least possible expenditure of the fewÕs amassed wealth (the one exception to this rule being their own fee for services provided).  They insist, as a matter of course, on exclusions and limitations of liability as the cost of doing business with their clients.  The destruction of watersheds, wetlands or supplies of safe potable water, while most certainly unfortunate are to be allowed but not factored into cost.  Incidental unsafe working conditions that harm, main, or cause the deaths of workers; the client must be free of any liability and such results cannot be factored into cost of doing business with the client.   Exclusion after exclusion and rejection of all culpability for any harm consequent to the enterprise are insisted upon and must be officially sanctioned. The few, now free of all responsibility for injury done, continue to dwell in their paradise of illusion and mirrored expectation while the many are forced to live with the dire consequences of the fewÕs greed, let loose upon them by the very apparatus of the state charged with insuring their safety and well-being.This misdirection of state apparatus results in increasing degradation of all environments, both natural and culturally conditioned.  Homes of wildlife and the people are destroyed, displaced or disappear, seas become deserts, lakebeds drained and all significant resources depleted without concern for future consequences.  The very air becomes a curse, choking all with toxins, noxious gasses and malodorous fumes.  The simple hope of having safe, potable water dwindles to a dream for those without the ready cash (or not participating in a cash economy) for purchasing this privilege.  Wildlife is left to adapt to or perish from the ever escalating presence of poisons, toxins and waste in their now, frequently, uninhabitable habitats.  These habitats, themselves, disturbed, degraded or destroyed, disappear. The recognition of ahimsa and a return to its reasonable application as the central principle for all systemsÕ operation is the only hope that our species possesses as a means for our continued existence on this planet.  Ahimsa, through its skillful practice, will lead to meaningful coexistence with our fellow humans and all other species and will answer the ever-escalating assault on the globe and her people.  The careful, considered implementation of this principle in practice will result in a more equitable sharing of resources, the re-evaluation of all means for ÒdevelopmentÓ and to a more careful and consistent examination of all pursued goals.  Ahimsa is our only way forward.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5515444,,0,1414942641559,1.41494E+12,0,,,[],

Wouldn't Zhuanzi enjoy our craziness! FWIW, as you can see below, it is far from a proven fact that the paradox exists, that income does not increase happiness, well being, definitely in the short run, and perhaps in the long run. Perhaps relative status and  adaptation do not explain things after all.Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers have published quite a bit about how the Easterlin Paradox is wrong:http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2013/04/subjective%20well%20being%20income/subjective%20well%20being%20income.pdfhttp://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/NewStylizedFacts(Emotion).pdfHere is Easterlin's responsehttp://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22463.fullHere is Wolfers speaking very recently at AspenWolfers and Frank at AspenIf happiness can be explained by statuss anxiety and influence, why do low income US citizens not move to Mexico, where they would be at the very top of the economic ladder? Why do middle income Mexicans move to the US where they are in the low income brackets??  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCV8IPlP-GEpdf of talkhttp://www.aspenideas.org/sites/default/files/transcripts/AIF11_052_econ_of_happiness.pdfHere is a summary of this dialogue in the Atlantic:""I came away thinking the Easterlin Paradox was a smoking wreck, and that pursuit of economic growth remains a worthy objective even for rich countries.""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/the-measure-of-human-happiness/241368/An October 2014 study which shows that we experience more negative well being from a downturn than positive well being from an upturn. Thus, the economy may improve but the net result of cyclical swings is that we are at net zero, even though the economy has improved:""On the one hand, a typical reading of the income-happiness paradox suggests that further growth in the developed world is a futile means to the end of improving societal well-being. On the other, researchers who find evidence of a positive relationship between well-being and GDP typically take from this that further economic growth is good for society. Our findings suggest a more nuanced perspective: policy designed to engineer economic \booms"", but that risks even relatively short \busts"" is unlikely to improve societal well-being in the long-run. Steady positive growth that minimizes the risk of economic contraction seems the most likely route to an improvement in general well-being.""http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1304.pdfThese articles show that subjective-well-being (SWB) inequality decreases with economic growth, a very important consideration:SWB INEQULITY AND INCOMEhttps://w.scu.edu/business/economics/workingpapers/upload/SWB-Inequality-and-Income.pdfhttp://www.melbourneinstitute.com/downloads/hilda/Bibliography/Working_Discussion_Research_Papers/2014/Clark_etal_Economic_growth_evens_out_happiness_dp1306.pdfThis is an important article that shows the efficiency with which countries use their increased wealth is an important consideration.

Photo by Temari on Flickr												Even the most mainstream psychiatrists might agree that yoga is like chicken soupÑit canÕt hurt. But researcher Chris Streeter has gone a step further toward validating yogaÕs potential to help treat depression and anxiety. In a study recently released in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, the BU School of Medicine assistant professor of psychiatry and neurology scanned the brains of practitioners and found that compared with that age-old stress reliever, walking, yoga appears to be accompanied by greater improvement in mood and decrease in anxiety and a boost in the brain chemical associated with these benefits. In StreeterÕs 12-week study, a group of 34 randomly selected physically and psychologically healthy young men and women were divided into two groups, one that walked for an hour three times a week and one that practiced Iyengar yoga for the same amount of time. At four-week intervals, Streeter used a technique known as magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor subjectsÕ levels of a brain chemical called gamma-amino butyric acid, or GABA, elevated levels of which are associated with improved mood and decreased anxiety. She found that the yoga group reported a greater boost in mood than the walking group, with GABA levels matching those improvements. Although the role of GABA still isnÕt completely understood, her study is the first to demonstrate the GABA-mood-yoga connection by looking at actual changes in the brain. BU Today spoke with Streeter about the implications of the study and the future of yoga as a way of treating mood disorders.BU Today: What is the main implication of this study?Streeter: This is the first study when weÕre able to measure GABAÕs relation to yoga. GABA is an important neurotransmitter, which is decreased in depressed people and increased in people who take so-called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), like Prozac, and itÕs also implicated in anxiety disorders. ItÕs been reported for years that yoga helps people with depression and anxiety, but in this study we took people who didnÕt have any experience with yoga and found that mood scales were higher in the yoga group, and so were GABA levels.Why did you choose Iyengar yoga?The beauty of Iyengar is that itÕs been around for a long time and itÕs pretty rigorous, with really well defined postures. And when you say itÕs an Iyengar intervention, people know what you mean. There are variations in it, but as far as yoga goes, itÕs as consistent as you can get. The other thing is, when people say Òyoga,Ó it could be breathing, postures, meditation, or all of those things. But I had the subjects do mainly postures because I could see them actually doing it.Do you think yoga alone could be a viable treatment for anxiety or depression?ItÕs been suggested. But I would say itÕs not a substitute, but rather an adjunct to treatment. ItÕs an exciting behavioral intervention, but the results here are associative, not causal. ThatÕs a problem, expanding these results to say that doing yoga as a substitute for oneÕs meds is a good idea. ItÕs not. And doing yoga without proper training or supervision is not advised.How does the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy change the nature of mood studies?ItÕs really exciting. The scan, which we use in conjunction with McLean Hospital, is really cutting-edge technology. Now we can measure what has historically been hypothesized. It used to be that if you could cut the brain, that was how you saw that these abnormalities were organicÑit was not, so to speak, in the personÕs head. But with functional imaging we have this picture that shows, gosh, hereÕs the brain of a depressed person before and after. ItÕs a much harder science.Why did you decide to compare yoga to walking?You really do need a control group. There have been a number of studies comparing aerobic and nonaerobic exercise that show exercise helps ease depression and anxiety. In this study, the walking group clearly had more exercise, and they were very active people. But the yoga group had more improvement in their mood than the walking group.Could yoga be used to treat bipolar disease and thought disorders as well as depression and anxiety?Yoga is probably always a good thing, more helpful than harmful. But some breathing exercises are not good for people who are manic or psychotic. They can trigger a psychotic episode.Is mainstream psychiatry becoming more receptive to yoga as a treatment tool?Doctors arenÕt necessarily trained to prescribe it. But there was a study of using yoga to help treat epileptics. And weÕre getting to the point when weÕre actually getting good data. Yoga research is increasing exponentially.How did you get interested in this research? IÕve been interested in yoga since I was in the seventh grade. I loved the mind-body interface, and yoga is a very interesting mind-body subject. It helps people deal with all kinds of problems.Do you practice yoga?Oh yes. IÕve done a lot of different typesÑashtanga, power yoga, Iyengar.People might misinterpret these results to mean that yoga is better than walking.

(Lin YuTang, trans. Chapter forty-two, Lines five and six. 1948)The above translations are of the same passage, chapter forty-two of the DaoDeChing.  This is the first appearance of these two concepts conjointly in the text and yet Prof. Slingerland chose not to mention it in his lecture on the concept of yin and yang.  The symbol, generally referred to as the Taijitu, or the diagram of the supreme ultimate, has its origins, perhaps, in the concepts presented in the text of the I Ching, allegedly of great antiquity.  Per tradition, the I Ching, is a text that even Confucius held in high esteem and regretted not having had more time to study.  The above text (DaoDeChing, chap.42) in all of the four translations would indicate to me that the concept is about the union of the two forces in harmony, not about, ÒThis cycle of reversion É something we want to get out of. And in that way, it actually is similar in certain ways to the idea of samsara and Buddhism, in early Buddhism.Ó  (Slingerland lecture, 3.6).  Per Richard Wilhem and Cary F. Baynes, who translated the I Ching:  The fundamental postulate is the ""great primal beginning"" of all that exists, t'ai chi Ð in its original meaning, the ""ridgepole""É. A still earlier beginning, wu chi, was represented by the symbol of a circle. Under this conception, t'ai chi was represented by the circle divided into the light and the dark, yang and yin,  . É what it posits is simply the ridgepole, the line. With this line, which in itself represents oneness, duality comes into the world, for the line at the same time posits an above and a below, a right and left, front and back Ð in a word, the world of the opposites. (Wilhelm, Richard and Cary F. Baynes. (1967). The I Ching or Book of Changes. Bollingen Series XIX, Princeton University Press. lv)I think the difference between my understanding of this symbol and Prof. SlingerlandÕs is one of focus.  He see the individual halves of the whole in some great opposing round.  I see the line, Òthe ridgepole,Ó and the circle presenting balance and harmony.  I do not say either focus is superior but I do think that the first paired mention of yin and yang in the DaoDeChing references harmony is significant.  On a side note, the Taijitu is usually seen as a good luck symbol in Chinese folk culture and is often paired with the following folktale:Once upon a time there lived a farmer in the three kingdoms of China.This farmer had a son who worked the farm with the help of a horse.The horse ran away one day.The local farmers came and said, ""How unlucky, your horse ran away.""The farmer said, ""Perhaps.""The next day, the horse came back, but was followed by a whole herd.When the local farmers found out, they said, ""You have great luck.""Again, the farmer said, ""Perhaps.""Another day passes, and the farmer's son broke his leg while riding some of the new horses.The local farmers again came, and this time they said, ""What bad luck, your son broke his leg.""The farmer repeated, ""Perhaps.""On the fourth day, the emperor's army were recruiting for the army and because of the son's broken leg, did not recruit him.The local farmers this time said, ""What great luck, your son did not get recruited.""The farmer again, repeated, ""Perhaps.""I will always see this symbol as a positive one.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5515444,,0,1415166693391,1.41517E+12,0,,,[],

In a classroom when you teach how to peer review you have a sense of who understands/appreciates the process and who needs more input, which is simply not possible with the MOOC peer review process as it stands - the result is that it becomes something of a lottery.  I'm not sure if there are any easy answers.  There's only so much you can do as an educator when you put out your guidance.  The final step involves students (a) internalizing it and (b) deciding that the incentives to act upon it in the manner the educator intended outweigh other impulses (which can range from ticking a few boxes simply to get their own participant marks through to transposing their own ideas/preconceptions on the subject/process).  That said, I do believe that the majority of people enter into the process with a commitment to making it a positive experience/tool for learning.My gut reaction is to take away any external rewards for completing a peer review assignment, so that the only motivation to complete the process is internal, but that opens a whole new can of worms...and doesn't address all of the issues anyway.Apologies if this reads as overly cynical, that's not my intention.  ",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,4255526,,0,1415171129874,1.41517E+12,0,,,[],

War would detract from that and drain wealth so order was important. It seems people were expected to contribute to their level of expertise and were rewarded for the same and particularly well rewarded for performance at high levels of govt. As today, if you didn't have the skills in top demand you were denied the big salary but at least you got enough to eat, a roof over your head and were able to marry and have children.

It is clear from the readings that Mozi saw that the desires of large states were leading to conquests of greed. In one chapter he talks about how a small state that has plenty of provisions and protection will be able to defend itself well, even from the attacks of a large state. He reasoned that in addition to the defense benefit, the small state with plenty of provisions would not be attacked by the large state, due to the great effort the large state would have to make to take the smaller one. Certainly the warring states period was a time of crisis, so it is reasonable to infer from this fact that Mozi would be so concerned with patterns of behavior which would lead to a state with a surplus of provision, but not necessarily to abundant wealth. He certainly wanted the least advantaged in the state to not be incredibly poor and starving. This is where I compare the consequentialism of Mozi, with the contract theory of John Rawls. Rawls wrote about the difference principle, which provides, with regard to distributive shares, that inequalities of wealth are allowable only if they result in a net increase in expectation for the least advantaged in society. Referring to Mozi, it is this same sort of reasoning which leads Mozi to condemn elaborate funerals. His reasoning is that: Since many resources, which have already been produced, would be sacrificed and buried with a king; and since the mourning period causes people to not be able to produce more resources, it is entirely detrimental to society to allow these practices. For, they cause the state to move farther away from the goal of the surplus of material provisions. Rawls would agree with Mozi's condemnation because the inequality of wealth, and certainly the sacrifice and burial of such wealth, does not benefit the least advantaged in society but rather imposes a further limit on their expectations, which is not just or fair at all.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5424324,,0,1415473042328,1.41547E+12,0,,,[],

In fact without imagination hope is impossible. Thus what are the tools of Hope, they must be the tools of the imagination.Where construct of the metaphor is critical, and where moral education comes from the understanding of sophisticated images. Where does Confucius send us to find and understand these? The Classics.This means I think that metaphor becomes a language ""above and beyond"" the literal construct. Where the combination for instance, especially in pairs provides a meaning.Thus if we take ""dark"" metaphors, we can have dark clouds, dark mountain, dark earth, dark wood, dark eyes, dark sea.What do these mean? From western literature we can stumble around, but there is little consistency and precision.Whereas with Chinese there clearly is precision, and at a very high level. That is because within the Chinese classics there is a ""schematic"" as to how that works.In fact from this one might argue that metaphor originates from Chinese, and certainly within western classics such as Homer, many of the metaphors are consistent with the Chinese system.I accept from previous advice that Yijing developed more fully in the Han. However the classical origin dates back much earlier, and can be seen in www.ctext.orgFrom this we see the building blocks of Chinese metaphor, are the 8 trigrams which are as follows [I think this is from a Legge translation of the Classic of Changes]:![enter image description here][1]Where as can be seen each attribute, Ch'ien, Tui, and so on has a range of associated references.Tui was mentioned in the lectures referring to ""push"" however in metaphor it also refers to lake, or marsh. In the image I think the directions may be wrong as generally I think Tui is associated with West.Thus if we go back to the ""dark"" metaphors above:we can have dark clouds [K'un-K'an], dark mountain [K'un-Ken], dark earth [K'un-K'un], dark wood [K'un-Sun], dark eyes [K'un-Li], dark sea [K'un-Tui].These compute on a classical matrix, which seems to be attributed from the Zhou Dynasty known as the the King Wen Sequence [maybe form around 1100BCE?]:![enter image description here][2]Thus we get the following:dark clouds [K'un-K'an]= 8, dark mountain [K'un-Ken]= 23, dark earth [K'un-K'un]= 2, dark wood [K'un-Sun]=20, dark eyes [K'un-Li]= 35, dark sea [K'un-Tui]= 45Where the numbers relate to chapters from the Chinese Classics were 8 is about [in general terms but there are a lot of details, as with all that follow] unity, 23 = deterioration, 2 = a natural response, 20 = contemplation, 35 = progress, and 45 = assembling. Which are all specific chapters in the Classic of Changes.Thus the notion of perceptive symbols within Chinese communication, literature and art, is certainly for higher levels of society standardized and formalised. That is the reason Confucius is advising to read the Chinese Classics.Therefore the schematic which is achieved creates what seems simple metaphor, but they are structured and obey laws and rules and from there contain embedded, powerful meanings.Thus following Confucius's advice and learning The Classics, one would learn and internalize these notions. From this point one has an exceptionally powerful cognitive base of cause and effect from which to advance from. What is very interesting is that if one looks at ancient western literature, such as Homer and Pindar the metaphor structures appear to follow the same rules.In Dante this becomes even more obvious, with specific reference to the marsh, the mountain, the abyss and so on. ""Dark Wood"" combines perfectly with the notion of chapter 20 of The Classic of Changes - something like the notion of contemplation.Thus it appears to me, that classical, certainly ancient western metaphors have their origin in this ""system"".One thing is for certain, that taking the time to learn the attributes, their computation and relating chapters once internalized, adds greatly to cognitive dexterity. I first realized this reading Homer for the first time a few years ago, as corpus ligustical concordance and collocation shows a very high correlation with key words associated with the Chinese classics, especially the Classic of Changes.Thus in my view, possibly the most important vehicle for advanced cognitive development in Ancient China was metaphor via its classical standardization, and application. Especially as a means of communication with other intellectuals. This seems significant in respect to ""how Chinese people thought"".   [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14157873315739961.jpg  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1415788214200885.gif",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1099483,3,0,1415789434563,1.41601E+12,1,Perceptual Symbols - Conceptual Metaphor,FALSE,['1099483'],discussion

I'm not a Christian but I can look inside myself and see the sprouts of such covetousness, which I routinely suppress. However I'm not sure they aren't as 'natural' a part of my make-up as the slight sentimentality I feel on seeing a distressed animal on the way to slaughter, from which I personally can't make the connection to benevolence towards my fellow man, which to me is a totally different response. I cook and eat meat and do, where I can, avoid harming animal life, but feel an absolute ban on harming humans. I agree with Mencius about the child in the well, but tend to see this as human solidarity, which if I think about it in any depth I'd trace back to humans having developed as communal animals. He's simply wrong about everyone having the same tastes, and as many examples can show some people will accept the most humiliating treatment as a way to prolong life, though some do not.

It takes a very long time to puzzle out, although certain aspects are available.The tricky part is the deciphering and application.I think it is ""hidden in plain sight"" material that like with Greek *ainos* one needed [or needs] certain skills and qualification to understand. Accordingly, I think it is a delicate topic that needs to be handled with a great deal of respect, and furthermore in line with such respect, it is not intended within the spirit of the system to be freely and openly exposed, in my view.  Confucius more or less points us towards such, but he makes us do the work to understand it more fully. In fact it is a lot of work, but most rewarding.You can find the precise reference form The Classics here:http://ctext.org/book-of-changes/shuo-guaFrom that you can create your own trigram attribute matrix, as the Shuo Gua, explains precisely the associated attributes.The following document explains the matter particularly well from the Paideusis Journal for Interdisciplinary and Cross-Cultural Studies:THE YIN-YANG SYSTEM OF ANCIENT CHINA: THE YIJING-BOOK OF CHANGES AS A PRAGMATIC METAPHOR FOR CHANGE THEORY, David Lam Center For International Communication, Simon Fraser University Vancouver (Burnaby), British Columbia. [I think its easier to read if you download the document].http://www.oocities.org/paideusis/n1ms.htmlI must say that this is one of the most fascinating and wide ranging sets of topics that I have come across ever. I am particularly interested in perfecting The Classics, and skills related to these topics. I hope we can form a group to continue study on this and other topics of interest after the course is completed, such as what Harvard have done with H25, which continues from their HeroesX course on Edx.I would very much appreciate guidance and input in mastering this system. Professor Slingerland makes reference to jujitsu. The above system is undoubtedly jujitsu for the cognition, and then some!It would be wonderful for all of us to work together to unpack this massive topic and exchange information to develop this fully. I think the amounts of embedded information / latent content, is very large. Regarding the source and transmission of such in ancient times, ChinaX Prof. Bol, advised in his Zhou Dynasty lecture that the Zhou passed on certain Chinese texts to ""barbarians"" in an attempt at intellectual colonization. Professor Puett, in another lecture stated that a lot of aspects of what we consider the facts of ancient western history are incorrect in some instances. The University of Jerusalem on their course on western mysticism related to Kaballah cite its origins in the east.In my view I think central to the transfer through elite circles was the Chaldean Magi / Zoroastrians, which I think is also where Nietzsche intimated [Thus spoke Zoroaster]. From them these elite notions peculated via elite circles in the Mediterranean area.There is possibly a cryptic reference on MIT's History of Global Architecture which may be seen to alluding to such a system from the Russian Steppe region.However TsinghauX - Cultural China Part one, goes into quite a bit of detail and evidence dating origins in China far earlier than for example we read of in the Greek classics on related topics.  I have found this to be a very sensitive topic for some. A particular ""red herring"" is the relationship to divination in the west, and discussing such systems as a form of horoscope. From my view I dismiss the mystical and look at the facts. The cause and effect relations, and human intervention relationships form something like a science of human situations and human interventions.

If one is without the heart of disdain, one is not a human. If one is without the heart of deference, one is not a human. If one is without the heart of approval and disapproval,27 one is not a human. The heart of compassion is the sprout of benevolence. The heart of disdain is the sprout of righteousness. The heart of deference is the sprout of propriety. The heart of approval and disapproval is the sprout of wisdom.28    ÒPeople having these four sprouts is like their having four limbs. To have these four sprouts but to say of oneself that one is unable to be virtuous is to steal from oneself. To say that oneÕs ruler is unable to be virtuous is to steal from oneÕs ruler. In general, having these four sprouts within oneself, if one knows to fill them all out, it will be like a fire starting up, a spring breaking through! If one can merely fill them out, they will be sufficient to care for all within the Four Seas. If one merely fails to fill them out, they will be insufficient to serve oneÕs parents.ÓÉMencius 2A6ÒHere is a person who is harsh to me. A gentleman in this situation will invariably examine himself, saying, ÔI must not be benevolent. I must be lacking in propriety.

What difference is there between a person like this and an animal?! What point is there in rebuking an animal?ÕÓ. . . Mencius 4B28	The above two excerpts from the Mencius text clearly indicate that Mengzi was fully aware of humanityÕs dual nature and further that he recognized this dual natureÕs origin.  He recognized that many of the apparently negative aspects of our nature stem from our animal needs and that compassion, disdain, deference and approval/disapproval arise out of the human abilities to reflect upon, predict likely outcomes and choose the correct one.  More importantly, though, he correctly asserted that all humans were born with these ÒsproutsÓ for what we today would refer to as humane and compassionate conduct. Modern neuroscience has proven him to be largely correct in this view.  	For a brief summary of these findings made by modern neuroscience I strongly recommend reading Karen ArmstrongÕs, Twelve Steps to a More Compassionate Life.   In the preface to this work she presents a rapid but intelligent overview of these discoveries and how they relate to the topic under discussion.  With regard to the more negative elements of human nature she states:		There is no doubt that in the deepest recess of their minds, men and women are indeed ruthlessly selfish.  This egotism is rooted in the Òold brain,Ó which was bequeathed to us by the reptiles that struggled out of the primal slime some 500 million years ago.  Wholly intent on personal survival, these creatures were motivated by mechanisms that neuroscientists have called the ÒFour FsÓ: feeding, fighting, fleeing, and-- for want of a more basic wordÑ reproduction.  These drives fanned out into fast-acting systems, alerting reptiles to compete pitilessly for food, to ward off any threat, to dominate their territory, seek a place of safety, and perpetuate their genesÉ.. Homo sapiens inherited these neurological systems; they are located in the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, and it is thanks to them that our species survived.  The emotions they engender are strong, automatic, and Òall about me.Ó (K. Armstrong, 13)After some additional comments and insights regarding these ÒnegativeÓ aspects of the human brain/psyche, she turns to the more positive elements of our human nature and their evolutionary originsThe arrival of warm-blooded mammals led to the evolution of a brain that was able to care for others and thus help ensure the survival of the young.   At first this care was rudimentary and automatic; but over the millennia, mammals began to build nests for their infants and began to behave in a way that would ensure their health and development.  For the first time, sentient beings were developing the capacity to protect, nurture, and nourish a creature other than themselves.  Over millions of years, this strategy proved so successful in establishing genetic lineages that it led to evolution of still more complex brain systems.  This process seems to have been symbiotic.  In order to accommodate these new skills, the brains of mammals got bigger; this meant that increasingly their young had to be born prematurely so that they could pass through the birth canal; the infants were, therefore, helpless and needed the support, care, and protection not only of their parents but of their entire community.  This was especially true of Homo sapiens, which had evolved an enormous brainÉ. But parental affection ensured the survival of the species, helped the young to thrive, and taught humans to develop other alliances and friendships that were extremely useful in the struggle for survival.  Gradually they developed the capacity for altruism. (K. Armstrong, 17-18) And further concerning the quiescence that mammals experience when not engaged in the pursuit of ÒFour FÓ goals:It used to be thought that this quiescence was simply the result of the more aggressive drives zoning out, but it has now been found that this physical relaxation is also accompanied in both mammals and humans by profound and positive feelings of peace, security, and well-being.  Produced initially by maternal soothing, these emotions are activated by such hormones as oxytocin, which induces a sense of closeness to others and plays a crucial role in the development of parental attachment.  When human beings entered this peaceful state of mind, they were liberated from anxiety and could, therefore, think more clearly and have fresh insights; as they acquired new skills and more leisure, some sought to reproduce this serenity in activities, disciplines, and rituals that were found to induce it. (K. Armstrong, 19}Ms. Armstrong also gives a brief tour of the neuroscience that provides the insights into the structures of the human brain that are involved in this human duality: 1878, French anatomist, Paul Broca, discovered a section of the brain that seemed older than the neocortex but not present in the brains of reptiles, he called it, le grand lobe limbique.  1959, American neuroscientist and physician, Paul MacLean, at US National Institute of Mental Health, using Paul BrocaÕs research and his own indicates that the limbic system, located beneath the neocortex, not the hypothalamus, was the source of the electrochemical stimuli that produce the ÒpositiveÓ emotions of compassion, joy, serenity and maternal affection. 1960Ós, American Roger Sperry of the California Institute of Technology demonstrated the differences between our right and left brain: left, center of logic, analysis, precision and cause and effect, right, center of emotion, symbolism, art and music. She also lists in her endnotes no less than twenty additional researchers in the field of neuroscience that have done further research that demonstrate the above linkages.  This modern science helps us to understand that human nature is not inherently ÒgoodÓ or Òbad,Ó that within us there is always a certain tension between these biochemical stimuli that generate our basic, urgent needs and those other biochemical stimuli that generate our ÒhigherÓ more empathetic feelings and actions. This tension generates our sense of free will, of needing to choose between compassionate action or selfish aims.  I do agree with both Mencius and Ms. Armstrong that the ÒpositiveÓ elements of our natures are frailer, require more attention for their full development and that they can be and frequently are short-circuited, crushed and nearly starved out of effectiveness by the secular ÒrealitiesÓ of our world.  I also insist with them that Òthose who have persistently trained themselves in the art of compassion manifest new capacities in the human heart and mind; they discover that when they reach out consistently to others, they are able to live with the suffering that inevitably comes their way with serenity, kindness, and creativity.  They find they have a new clarity and experience a richly intensified state of being.Ó (K.

The metaphors the writer lists are: timetables (to add a time pressure), ""war is a game"" (like comparing Saddam to a petulant child), ""making the case/selling the plan"" (to justify the war rationally), driving metaphors (""to justify the inevitability of war""), disease/germs (WMDs as diseases, US as doctor remedying the Iraqi disease), and dehumanization.

The differences we see in cultures is due to adaption to particular circumstances and to cultural drift which is analogous to genetic drift.

My understanding is that, in reality, we have free will only in our responses to things (events, things, people) that come into our path and in our thoughts, feelings, and actions. That we are ultimately responsible for the direction of our lives and for the actions, thoughts, and feelings that we produce in this life.In Some Answered Questions 'Abdu'l-Bah‡ talks about the nature of free will (p. 248-250). His discourse is too lengthy to quote here, but His main points are:1  Good and evil actions (e.g., justice or injustice) are subject to free will. We are responsible for these acts.2 Other aspects of life are forced upon us (e.g., sleep, death, sickness, and misfortunes beyond our control). We are not responsible for these things.3 At the same time, ""might and power belong especially to God"" and we are therefore absolutely dependent upon God's help.  For example, states of existence (mineral, vegetable, animal, or human) are decreed by God and act as limiting factors on what creatures can become. ""Their progress must be in their own state.""As human beings, we occupy the highest state, but as individuals we vary in capacity. In 1 Romans 9:21, it is said that God is like a potter who makes ""one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour."" As this is God's doing, it is not for us to complain about our inherent limitations. Rather, we should exercise our free will to develop our God-given capacities.4  Even in this regard, however, ""the inaction or the movement of man depend upon the assistance of God."" He likens us to a ship powered by wind or steam. The ship's course can be controlled via its rudder, but without the power of wind or steam the ship will not move.

In my understanding, there is truth that is universal - values, standards that apply to the entire human race.  This is the first assumption of a belief or fact of the universe -- that there are universal standards of truth.  From where does this truth come?  The only possible source from which this universal education could come, as I understand it, is God - the One Shang Tian, Whose guidance is given throughout all time through the Manifestations of God, the Teachers of Heaven.  Definitely not anything or anyone who is ""not divine"" - Adolf Hitler?  And also not human.  How could it be otherwise?  We are the created, the limited in this limitless universe.  Though limited, we are possessed with enormous potential and creative capacity and purpose - far greater than we can possibly imagine, is my understanding.  (This naturally leads to the question of human and non-human kingdoms and levels of existence, i.e., mineral, vegetable, animal, human, Holy Spirit. This is another assumption of a belief or fact of the universe, that there is a level of existence above the human world.)Today people are ""stuck"" with the word ""God"" and find it problematic.  Today, though, we can learn there is new meaning of the word.  God is but one word, it doesn't matter the word - Shang Tian, Heaven, Allah, the Creator, the Ultimate Reality, the Great Spirit, the Universal Source - so many different words, as many as there are people, yet they all refer to, in the final analysis, from my studies, to the same Thing.  This becomes one of the tests for us in the world - attachments to words, concepts, previous knowledge.  According to Baha'u'llah, the latest in the line of the Divine Teachers, we learn that God is ""the Unknowable Essence"" - we will never know the essence of this Creator.  Yet, at the same time, we are to come to the ""knowledge and love of God"" in this life, how this is the purpose of life.  So, we can't stop here - this definition leads to other questions.   There have been many wise philosophers throughout the ages - Plato, Kongzi, so many in every culture.Likewise, there have been many universal Manifestations of God throughout time, each with a Teaching according to the time and capacity of the people - some examples, Krishna, Buddha, Moses, Christ, Muhammad and, for today, the Bab and Baha'u'llah.  This is another assumption of a belief or fact - that the Divine Teachers, past and present, have brought an education that was and is universal.  In the future, there will be more.  Eternal in the past, eternal in the future, says Baha'u'llah.  All of Them are the Way and unified in their essence.  It is only through the study of these Heavenly Teachers that we can know anything about God and the universal values for today. According to Baha'u'llah:  ÒThe knowledge of Him, Who is the Origin of all things, and attainment unto Him, are impossible save through knowledge of, and attainment unto, these luminous Beings who proceed from the Sun of Truth.Ó There is a difference, in my understanding of the various spiritual texts, between the philosopher and Manifestation of God.So, we continue onward in study and quest, using all of the available knowledge for us.  We independently seek the truth from whichever source its springs.  This is what both science and religion claim - that truth is one, though infinitely diverse in variations, yet whole in essence. Sharing only from my limited perspective.  In sum, an important thing to consider is how the study of truth using both the systems of science and (all) religion is just like any other subject - physics, math, language, music, and that we must actually study the Words and read, discuss, think, and question. We can't say no to some and yes to others.  We need to know what each of these Teachings say.

I am minded of the boot-camp sub-genre of war films.In the 1982, double-Oscar-winning (7 nominations), feel-good film ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", Richard Gere plays Zack Mayo, an aloof, taciturn man who aspires to be a navy pilot. Once he's arrived at training camp for his 13-week officer's course, Mayo runs afoul of abrasive, no-nonsense drill sergeant Emil Foley. Mayo --or ""Mayonnaise,"" as he is dubbed by the irascible Foley -- is an excellent cadet, but a little cold around the heart. Foley rides Mayo mercilessly, sensing that the young man would be prime officer material if he weren't so self-involved. Zack's affair with working girl Paula (Debra Winger) is likewise compromised by his unwillingness to give of himself. Only after Mayo's best friend commits suicide over an unhappy romance does Zack come out of his shell and mature into a real human being. Richard Gere, of course, wins through to become an Officer and a Gentleman... and get the girl.Compare this with Stanley Kubrick's 1987 (only one Oscar-nomination) film ""Full Metal Jacket"". This film crystallizes the de-humanizing experience of the Vietnam War by concentrating on a group of raw Marine volunteers. The film's first half details the volunteers' harrowing boot-camp training under the profane, power-saw guidance of drill instructor Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a real-life drill instructor whose performance is one of the most terrifyingly realistic on record). Part two takes place in Nam, as seen through the eyes of the now thoroughly indoctrinated marines.However, I am not so sure about your assertion that:> Good behaviour is a conscious choice.The difficulty of resisting evil socialization processes is a point brought out even in the trailer for the Oscar winner ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX0MPcN08ZcPhilip Zimbardo tells us we should hold the rotten-apple barrel-makers to account. http://video.mit.edu/watch/the-lucifer-effect-understanding-how-good-people-turn-evil-9241/I was delighted to see Mark Carney (governor of the Bank of England) using this vocabulary today: http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/17/banking-culture-overhaul-mark-carney-bankers-payKind regardsGeoffrey",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1756823,,0,1416241893121,1.41624E+12,0,,,[],

I am not quite sure about all of what you wrote.  I shared your comment with one of my friends and here is her general understanding...Human rights and the call for justice and all that implies is a spiritual concept, not an ideal or a concept - but a spiritual reality.  Already there are general moral and ethical principles upon which people of the world have already agreed, for example the UN charters, declarations, and agreed upon rights of humanity, children, and women. All of these can be expressed in the context of the various cultures, although those local cultural practices that violate human rights, for example, female circumcision and marrying off young girls with or without their consent, will have to be forgone to guarantee human rights for all members of the society.  We can see this same pattern already practiced in federations of states like the USA or EU which have their regional laws but give up certain prerogatives to the larger overarching governing council.  That's also the idea of the UN itself, though humanity is still striving to reach the level of maturity required to make it work effectively.  Looking at our achievements historically give reason for hope.  We have far to go, but historical precedent gives hope.  Additionally, a close examination of the diverse Baha'i international community demonstrates a highly successful working model in progress that applies these moral and ethical principles enshrined in the various charters and declarations.  ---Regarding longtime proven values - I agree with this, how longtime values help create well established cultures.  But what kind of culture are you talking about?  Do you mean cultures that have kept their history alive?    I believe new cultures can establish a community based on shared values - these values are the same values from long ago but with new meaning and potency in this new day.  Love, truthfulness, humility, justice, kindness - these and other values are spiritual realities from time immemorial, eternal in the past, eternal in the future, yet in this new day they all have new meaning.  These virtues or values have always been the basis of culture.  If they are now not a reality of the culture, it is because people have lost the way.  It should be understood how the meanings of concepts and values change over time.  For example, to ""love the world"" today means something very different from 2,000 ago when the world was infinitely smaller than it is today.  So, today we are met with a new challenge in living the value to ""love the world"".  In the Baha'i experience, followers of the Baha'i way are establishing ""unity in diversity"" - universal values that apply to all people and cultures while preserving the beauty of the varying peoples and cultures.  It is a fact that in every culture there are good things that should stay and be kept alive and there are not-good things that should go and be forgotten.  As for the human being, together we share an essential reality - the spiritual reality of our oneness.  The other part - the customs, the language, the tastes, colors and textures of culture - this diversity is precious and what brings beauty to the world.  The people of the world, the different culture in all its diversity can be compared to a beautiful garden with infinite variety and diversity in its make-up.  Yet we all, the myriad different flowers receive the same life-growing energy from the same Source of life.  I'm not sure if this response was quite the point needed, but share with you...",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,4652068,,0,1416280442935,1.41628E+12,0,,,[],

Priam comes in unseen and he immediately grasps Achilles' legs and kisses Achilles' hands, the way a man begging for his life would do in Ancient Greek times.  Priam then says:""Achilleus like the gods, remember your father, one who is of years like mine, and on the door-sill of old age...surely he, when he hears of you and that you are still living, is gladdened within his heart and all his days he is hopeful that he will see his beloved son come home from the Troad."" (Book 24, lines 486-492)He then tells Achilles of the pain he has suffered after losing so many of his sons, and begs Achilles to return the body of Hector.  Priam ends his speech by calling on Achilles to ""take pity upon [him-Priam] remembering [his-Achilles'] father.""This stirs Achilles' heart, causing him to ""grieve for his own father"" and he and Priam begin to weep, each for his own sorrows.  This causes Achilles to feel pity for Priam, and he finally relents and returns the body of Hector, after washing it and anointing it, taking care to keep Hector's body out of Priam's sight, so as not to upset and anger Priam.Achilles finally regains his humanity after Priam calls upon him to think of his own father and then take his love for his own father and extend it to Priam.

This course is among the best I have taken.  The course is well-thought out.  The videos are very professionally done and clearly have taken a substantial amount of time to film, to edit, and to finalize.  (Kudos to the videographer!!)  The material is clear, both through the on-screen outlines and bullets in the videos, as well as the various episodes and outlines for each module. I particularly appreciate the time that Prof. Slingerland and others have taken to provide an annotated bibliography for additional reading or resources, or just studies mentioned in the lectures.  The quiz questions help to reinforce the learning from the readings and the lectures.  And to top it off the class is fun.  I appreciate the instructor's humor and the videographer's wit in including, for instance, outtakes the first couple of weeks.I know that this required (and still does require) a significant amount of time by all involved.  (Heck, I imagine that the time involved might make some graduate students' or other staff's compensation less than minimum wage!)

Its tiring - and boring actually, to be reminded of not being a guy but (good news!!!) ""human beings"" all the same.  The analects, points, proverbs, odes ect. have content to contemplate for human beings.  Please stretch and appreciate women's massive tasks thus far in humanity to lend context of these sages to human experiences. Surely 1. the height of determination of women to raise children amid situations of shear duress, 2. be paid billions less - over time, as they struggle to get by with or without a husband/partner/extended family, 3. guide a totally confused/crying/stressed youth with algebra homework while simultaneously cooking for three other children, 4. __________(fill in the blank for a friend) or 5. All of the above, would warrant less gender preference in conversations on the content of the sages, and more relating their 'content' to the human self, no matter the gender. This all may seem a bit much but i am trying to drive the point home. Unfortunately women who need help have homes that are often too far to reach. It is, has been and continually will be placidly exhaustive to be (figuratively) mitigated and (literally) financially shortchanged by otherwise interesting and engaging (fellas..come on now..) human beings. Please understand all that. Okay - to drive this all back home, this course is throughly engaging, Edward Slingerland top notch and has me seriously determined to return to work on another degree - once my not-at-all little one goes to college in just about two years.  I am leaving the male dominated field I work after it has been a financial failure for year, its sad that being good at my job didn't provide me with the success a good male friend is having after his first year in the industry with no formal education in the field at all, he had never stepped foot in a classroom. Some may read this and ask where my violin is. I don't have one yet my piano needs tuning (smile!)  Cumulatively it isn't easy, the other half of the world needs to widen their mind to the human part of women's lives. You might not get it, depending on where or where you are not coming from.

She perfectly embodies your point: ""regarding the stranger as worthy of the kind of care that you have within your [emotional and economic] power to give"". The downside is that she immediately discovers the complexity of the issues and the inadequacy of our instant Western judgements. The cost and benefit to her is a life-changing experience she was not prepared for.I am a white person born in Central Africa, and brought up by African nannies (my mother declared she was ""not interested in children until they could conduct an intelligent conversation with her"") and have subsequently travelled a lot. I guard against the hardening of the heart and so find the ubiquity of real human tragedy in places like Africa particularly challenging.Sorry about all the links. I much prefer ""Wu-wei"" to ""the emergence of Collective Intelligence"". I do think that our philosophical ruminations have to be grounded - and that is one the many things I find so excellent about this MOOC.

At first I was a bit snarky feeling in my heart about it, but after this lecture in this module, I think his view (up till now) is pretty spot on. Showing that Confucius and Laozi are both teetering on the horns of the internal vs. external dilemma, sorta, sorry for the pun, balances things out and makes me feel like he's not so biased... not SO biased that I don't like the guy.

I wanted the Daoists to win, but I have to admit, based off of my experience abroad and in Daoism groups, that the dark side of Daoism does exist.

I think that ZZ does attempt to straddle the internal vs. external dilemma and ride the bull off to wherever he's going, to the beach or wall-street or wherever. In a way you can say someone who is labeled as a Daoist (Zhuangzi) does a pretty good job of dealing with the dilemma (or is it the editor, Guo Xiang, of the ZZ that should get the credit?) and the Daoists can let out a sigh of relief.

The protagonist after attending his mother's funeral, apathetically kills a man. In January 1955, Camus said, ""I summarized The Stranger a long time ago, with a remark I admit was highly paradoxical: 'In our society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death.'

Perhaps I can contribute a painful experience that illustrates the power of such ideas.My daughter was damaged at birth and grew up awkward in her actions and unable to maintain eye contact without moving her head. She was very bright. As parents, we tended to minimise her disability by saying ""everybody is different, you might seem a bit clumsy but you are off-the-scale when it comes to smarts"". When she hit puberty, ignorant kids at school labelled her spastic. This came as a blow and she became anorexic. The  "" undergrowth in the head"" says ""if you can control your appetite then you can control anything"". And it sort of works as hunger drives other thoughts out of the brain. Of course, anorexia leads to all sort of ills as the body shuts down and eventually dies.At one level, the cure is easy: ""eat your food and you will feel better"". But just try telling an anorexic this and they will start throwing things at you.We ended up at The Priory, the UK's pre-eminent clinic for this sort of thing. After various treatments that only seemed to make things worse, we met with the family therapist who attempted the reframing of the ""monkey trainer"". He interviewed us separately then he brought us back together and said: ""I have been listening to Alice (not her real name) and it seems to me that the problems she is describing are the problems of a teenager not the problems of an anorexic. So my question to you is: do you think that she is first-and-foremost a teenager or first-and-foremost an anorexic?"" Naturally we answered ""teenager"". I don't want to minimize the huge effort that followed  but this marked a turnaround (""pivot"") in her condition. Anorexic no more, Alice married one of her therapists, has two lovely children and is currently completing a PhD dissertation on eating disorders.Kind regardsGeoffrey",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1756823,2,0,1417254324616,1.41725E+12,3,Anorexia: a problem of undergrowth in the head,FALSE,"['5803128', '2775274', '136762']",discussion

Start with Ferlingetti: how can a voice be glaucous?  Glaucous: (1a) of a pale yellow-green color, (1b) of a light bluish grey or bluish white color (2) having a powdery or waxy coating that gives a frosted appearance and tends to rub off.  (Webster Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary).  Investigating still further we find that it also refers to the ÒGlaucous,Ó a gull but also as ÒGlaucus,Ó to a fish. Glaucous and Glaucus have same origin from the Greek via Latin (OED, 1985).  In this we see the color is an uncertain blending from one into another.  The Tao gives birth to the One, the One to the Two, the Two to the Three: from the Three are born the ten thousand beings (Daode ching, 42). The Voix Glauque, oboe dÕamore sounds distantly insistently, a distant, far, faint echoing that provides an exultant harmony that stretches over us.  It is both pale and bright far and yet here holding all.  The one is the involved observer; the two are the observer and the observed which are three in that  they together birth a new awareness.  Only for the original observer are is this awareness transmissible?  Only if the receiver knows the thing, him or her self. From the four Canons:  The Primordial Tao as such cannot be known without giving birth to another, the two who then generate the three and finally the ten thousand. But in this knowing lies the secret to unknowing. But the knowing/unknowing is dependent on the singular autonomy of the self as such.  In that moment, there lies no need for a normative for it simply is/is not.   ",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5515444,,0,1417281532149,1.41728E+12,1,,,['2550130'],

I think this is addressed to some degree by the material covered in earlier chapters and in the article by Russell Brand - where we need to play some head games with ourselves or where there are cultural head games (e.g., marketing) to make disparities ""all right"".But I think underlying all these is the notion of values, and in particular, competing values. And that often our competing values are largely unexamined and/or the cultural pressures (aka cultural values) make it hard to (or at a minimum, don't support) to act on some ""smaller"" personal values more consistently.There is plenty of evidence to show we mimic people around us and that they mimic us. We may believe we don't need such a big house or such an expensive wine, but we will have competing values for social connection -- to ""fit in"" -- with our social networks. So, if we are going to choose to ""deny"" one value, we need a support structure to maintain it and that support structure is often sadly lacking in north american cultures. There aren't many of us that would turn away from existing social structures to create a different social network that would support the competing value. If we pay attention to the ""value"" issue - the internal part of the equation -- I think we can have had a stronger impact than the external focus alone or the internal focus alone.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,2439330,0,0,1417296980709,1.4173E+12,0,Impartiality and Self-Sacrifice,FALSE,[],discussion

The second translation is work of a scholar who feels that the poetic structure suggests that it was a part of an existing oral tradition dating it from a much earlier period.Brief summary concerning the Neiye:A long-overlooked text of classical times, the Neiye (""Inner Cultivation"" or ""Inner Development"") is a text of some 1600 characters, written in rhymed prose, a form close to that of the Daode jing. It sometimes echoes that text and the Zhuangzi, but it lacks many of the concerns found in those works. Generally dated to 350-300 BCE, it is preserved in the Guanzi (ch. 49), along with two later, apparently derivative texts, Xinshu, shang and xia (ch. 36-37). The Neiye had extremely profound effects on Taoism and Chinese culture. It seems to have influenced (1) the form, and certain contents, of the Daode jing; (2) the self-cultivation beliefs and practices of many later Taoists (from the Huainanzi and Taiping jing to the 20th-century); and (3) certain fundamental concepts of traditional Chinese medicine. It may also have influenced Neo-Confucian ideals of self-cultivation, by way of Mencius' teachings on cultivating the heart/mind (xin) and building up qi (Mengzi 2A.2).The Neiye seems to be the earliest extant text that explains and encourages self-cultivation through daily, practiced regulation of the forces of life. Those forces include *qi (""life-energy"" the universal force that gives life to all things); and *jing (""vital essence"" one's innate reservoir of qi). (There is no trace here of the much later Chinese concept that jing referred to reproductive fluids.) Like Mencius, the Neiye suggests that the xin was originally as it should be, but now needs rectification (zheng). The xin becomes agitated by excessive activity, which leads to dissipation of one's jing, resulting in confusion, sickness, and death. To preserve one's health and vitality, one must quieten (jing) one's xin. Then one can then attract and retain qi, and other vaguely interrelated forces, such as shen (""spirit"" or ""spiritual consciousness""), and tao (a vague term, apparently interchangeable with shen and ch'i). (Such concepts are explained more intelligibly in passages of the Huainanzi: see Roth 1991).""Hope this info is helpful re your understanding of Qi.A ÒscientificÓ way of understanding qi may be indicated by the first chapter: The vital essence of all things: It is this that brings them to life. It generates the five grains below Ð Ask yourself what is the basic form of cellular respiration? The Krebs cycle.The citric acid cycle Ð also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), or the Krebs cycle,[1][2] Ð is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy through the oxidation of acetate derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In addition, the cycle provides precursors of certain amino acids as well as the reducing agent NADH that is used in numerous other biochemical reactions. Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may have originated abiogenically.[3]The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from citric acid (a type of tricarboxylic acid) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle. In addition, the cycle consumes acetate (in the form of acetyl-CoA) and water, reduces NAD+ to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct. The NADH generated by the TCA cycle is fed into the oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport) pathway. The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of ATP.In eukaryotic cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria which lack mitochondria, the TCA reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface (plasma membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycleThis cycle of energy production is so basic to life on earth that it is common to both plants and animals. Indeed it would be hard to imagine a more subtle energy than the one elaborated as the Krebs cycle and yet more basic to life itself. The danger in looking at qi in this way is that it delimits its form and function and so remains an incomplete elaboration of it. ",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5515444,,0,1417455700182,1.41746E+12,0,,,[],

He played trumpet and violin and was a very fine artist. His art teachers particularly liked his work because through successive sketches and drafts they could see his ideas gradually emerge to become more and more refined. He went on to Oxford got a first in Maths and Philosophy and eventually a PhD in maths, discovering a couple of equations in complexity science significant enough to be named after him. After that he won a top apprenticeship in the Advertising industry, a sort of latter-day Don Draper... and for the first time in his life failed at a self-appointed task.My second son did well, but not so well, at school. He is an artist. His core skill is photography (he picked up a camera at age 5 and never looked back), but also a very good painter and stone carver. However he fell out with his art teachers because they could never see his work develop. He would go into internal search, frustrate them by giving them no intermediate studies to mark, then suddenly  pop out a brilliant completed work at the very last minute. Consequently they forecast him a B grade in A-level art (""for not trying hard enough"", sic). The English University Entrance System goes on forecasts not actual grades as the exams are marked too late. So he failed to get into Oxford to read fine arts, even though his eventual grade was an A: he would have had to wait a year for admission. Instead he went to the National Film and Television School, their youngest ever student by years, their first David Lean scholar, and graduated with an MA in cinematography with distinction from the Royal College of the Arts in just two years. And, as we only learnt ten years later, he got the highest marks (99%) ever awarded for A-level art. He has gone on to found an extraordinarily successful Advertising-Agency/Production-Company in the Branded Content arena. In an industry famed for big egos and self-promotion, my second son is extremely self-effacing and quite happy to let his work go unattributed believing it has to speak for itself, the cognoscenti will surely know who produced it. He is superstitious about the roots of his success and hates it when I point them out to him. Basically, as a shooter-director, he is so unobtrusive and so observant that his subjects eventually forget that he is there and he quickly is able to capture those unguarded moments that touch their souls. Here is a tiny example http://jamesmh.net/1447/20981/films/andreas-blank I love the look of devotion of Andreas Blank's dancer.Season's GreetingsGeoffrey",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1756823,0,0,1417509876961,1.41759E+12,2,Gradual versus sudden,FALSE,"['4278651', '1909379']",discussion

I am also curious what Professor Slingerland thinks of my ideas with respect to both the classical materials we are studying, and current definitions of these concepts.I am trained as a Chinese medical practitioner in the United States and as such have both Eastern training and Western training.  These ideas come up often in our education, and are familiar to anyone who studies the classical Chinese medical texts, which interestingly enough, come out of the Warring States period.  The question Òwhat is qi?Ó is commonly asked throughout the medical education process as well as by patients in the medical office who wish to understand this concept in the context of their treatments, specifically acupuncture and medical diagnosis.  Practitioners and students of Chinese medicine, in the United States at least, often come up with explanations or definitions of ÔqiÕ which may or may not be accurate, helpful, or appropriate.

I want to preface this by saying that this is only an explanation of qi in the context of neuropsychology and physiology.  I understand and appreciate that qi is a broad term that has far wider definitions and applications.One helpful explanation and illustration of 'qi' is the simple pointing the amazing yet easily neglected fact that our body is constantly ÔdoingÕ things with or without our conscious effort.  This is ÔqiÕ in a general sense Ð observed activity with apparent intelligent patterns.  You want to experience your ÔqiÕ?  Just consciously move your arm, or open and close your eyes.  This is ÔqiÕ.  Want to experience ÔqiÕ that you are not directly controlling Ð close your eyes and feel your heart beating, your blood circulating.  This is also ÔqiÕ.While this may seem overly simplistic, I believe it illustrates how universal the concept of ÔqiÕ is and also explains why it is so easy to misconstrue it for something magical or beyond normal human understanding.  It also explains why the Chinese related it to concepts such as water, air/wind, cosmic energy, ghosts, steam, vapor, and the like.Another way to understand ÔqiÕ, particularly in a neurophysiological sense, is to think of ÔqiÕ as information.  Take cellular and wireless technology as a metaphor to illustrate that information is transmitted that cannot be seen, but can be measured/sensed and which triggers changes on either end of the pathway/channel/nerve.ÔQiÕ is, in a most general sense, the information and interaction of information-systems.  Whether it is a mechanical system, a biological system, or an electrical system, information is being transmitted, which can affect change or other information to respond.  In medicine, we apply techniques (acupuncture, massage, pharmacology) to the body Ð we intentionally apply information to generate a response from the body, which we measure by the bodyÕs response, based on our ability to notice changes in the body (e.g. pulses, skin response, pain reduction, etc.).When Xunzi talks of Òcontrolling the qiÓ Ð he is speaking of consciously applying the heart/mind (xin) to affect change within the emotional system of our body.  Xunzi also describes the xin as, ÒThe heart dwells in the central cavity so as to control the five facultiesÑ this is called oneÕs ÒHeavenly ruler.Ó (Xunzi Ch17).  Xunzi, uses similar descriptions of the mind as the central leader of other aspects of mental processes as governed by the organ systems.  This brings us to the discussion of ÔxinÕ and its definition in the context of Chinese medicine.Xin has been translated in our course text as ÔheartÕ but this same character, we Prof. Slingerland mentioned earlier in the course, also can be translated as ÔmindÕ.  This definition points to the classical Chinese understanding that the mind and body are interrelated and as such aspects of mental processes are associated with physical organs and physiological processes and systems.  For Xunzi and surely some of his medical contemporaries, the mind was ÔseatedÕ in the heart and played part in the physiological process of blood circulation, cognitive control, memory and conscious experience.  For Xunzi, the heart was the guiding, leading aspect of human mental processes, both conscious and unconscious.  This idea continues into current day Chinese medical theory and understanding of the body which looks at the mind-body as an integrated functional overlay of systems with distinct and interrelating information and processes.Without totally going off an complete tangent, I find this very intriguing and hope I have given some insight into these concepts that contribute to our discussions.

This idea continues into current day Chinese medical theory and understanding of the body which looks at the mind-body as an integrated functional overlay of systems with distinct and interrelating information and processes.Without totally going off an complete tangent, I find this very intriguing and hope I have given some insight into these concepts that contribute to our discussions.

Aristotle seems to ""discover"" a number of concepts that were already well versed in China.What is more, is that metaphors in Chinese and Greek writing are often very similar. This must lead one to consider that the esoteric aspect of the Greek, incorporated Chinese systems. Thus perhaps there is a lot more to the marriage of east and west than we read in Homer, or that esoterically it is what we read in Homer?Yet in academic circles some go to great lengths to deny such. Whilst others such as Puett, Harvard, advocates a need to dig deeper, and discount a range of established thoughts.> Plutarch claims that the second, less popular category of AristotleÕs> writings concerns:> > *the secret [aporrata, not to be spoken] and deeper things, which men> call by the special term acroamatic and epoptic and do not expose for> the many to share*. Ð Plutarch, Alexander 7.3Ð5, in Lives (unpublished> translation by Jenny Strauss Clay)> > He continues that when Alexander the Great, AristotleÕs former pupil,> heard that his teacher had decided to publish some of the acroamatic> discourses, he wrote to him in protest. Aristotle then replied in the> following letter, which is featured in AndronicusÕ edition of his> writings, and which Plutarch carefully describes and Gellius quotes in> full:   *Aristotle to King Alexander, prosperity. You have written me> about the acroatic discourses, thinking that they should be guarded in> secrecy. Know, then, that they have been both published and not> published.* For they are intelligible only to those who have heard us.> Ð Gellius, Attic Nights 20.5.12., translated by Lorraine Pangle in> Aristotle and the Philosophy of Friendship, 9.> > While the authenticity of this letter is questionable, it may still> present an informed account of the character of AristotleÕs writings.> What we do know is that a thinker and historian of the stature of> Plutarch finds the content of the letter accurate in light of his own> personal reading of Aristotle. For, as he goes on to explain:> > *To say the truth, his books on metaphysics are written in a style> which makes them useless for ordinary teaching, and instructive only,> in the way of memoranda, for those who have been already conversant in> that sort of learning.* Ð Plutarch, Alexander 7.3Ð5 in Lives. All> sourced from Prof. Melzer's [Michigan] Esoteric Appendix.In some Greek esoteric writing, then in Latin, then in for example Dante, they are clearly using Chinese Bagua [Trigram] metaphors, which produce a double meaning.You make reference to Dante in the video:> *the text and the mystery that lies beneath it. Thus, it simultaneously> challenges the intellect of the wise while it gives comfort to the> minds of the simple. It possesses openly something to give children> nourishment and yet reserves in secret something to hold with> fascinated admiration the minds of the deepest meditators. Therefore,> it is like a river, so to speak, both shallow and deep, in which the> little lamb may wade with its feet and the great elephant may swim> freely.Giovanni Boccaccio, Life of Dante*Melzer in his recent books cites an intentional error by Machiavelli, to alert the informed reader to esoteric aspects of his work. Such is the nature of ""errors"".The practical reality being that ancient Chinese knowledge has been a method of esoteric discourse in the west from ancient times.The question then being once one understands such, and can read it in part, how does one develop it, and communicate about such with others that understand the matter? How does one put such understanding to good use in productive, practical application?> > ",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1099483,,0,1417673948467,1.41768E+12,0,,,[],

Also the point that you were making about the broader concept of religion (in the Introduction) and that it is not equivalent to believing in God but having a certain worldview and a corresponding value system made me think a lot.

That view is pathetic and despicable and the reason is that it causes other people (in this example human beings who by accident of birth happen to not have a Y chromosome) harm (physical or otherwise) for no reason and makes him superior (for being male). How pathetic. If I, as a WEIRD white male would say to him that he has less (human) rights because I am white and he is not that would be equally pathetic. I also DO think that humanity in general has made significant progress over the last centuries in terms of becoming more humane, e.g. you made reference to Steven Pinker who describes how the death penalty some hundred years ago was applied for even minor transgressions, after some time ""only"" for capital crimes and by now has been abolished in many countries.The general rule to compare different worldviews and their corresponding (mis)values to me is whether unnecessarily harm is inflicted on another person.

I think it's possible to realize that such values are ultimately founded on a particular type of faith, and yet still adhere and promote those values anyway based on that very same faith. This insistence that *our* moral values are rooted in objective universal truths and others are not isn't really a necessary step for holding onto what we believe, and in fact the insistence on rationalism as a necessary component of morality is itself a moral value borne of the enlightenment tradition. *Prescriptive* moral relativism, the claim that *no* moral claims are superior to others because they're all ultimately faith based, and that therefore we shouldn't judge or that we should just leave other countries alone to practice whatever they care to, is itself a moral stance. We can oppose prescriptive moral relativism and non-interventionalism and still keep our beliefs internally consistent if we make explicit our *faith* commitment to metaphysical beliefs in gender equality, the dignity of individuals, and the affirmation of ordinary life.On more pragmatic terms, rationalist arguments for one's own values that bottom out at ""well mine are self evidently rational and yours are just pathetic"" can be a satisfying form of self affirmation, but tend not to be very persuasive for people who don't share your values. Sam Harris showing pictures of women in burkas and insisting that there just has to be something objectively wrong with people who promote that is not going to convince wahhabists any more than a fundamentalist cleric swearing up and down that female university students wearing shirts and jeans just has to be objectively wrong is ever going to convince western liberals. Yet if all morality is ultimately founded on faith, then at some level of rationalist debate such arguments for self-evidentness become unavoidable. So again pragmatically, if you're on the ground in Afghanistan and you want the local populace to support your vision of western liberal morality and not be constantly at your throat because they think you've brought about hell on earth, then avoiding the pitfalls of rationalist rhetoric and reaching out to actually change the minds of people like that ""pathetic"" village elder become a life or death matter of foreign policy.  It's here that acknowledging the relative nature of morality, studying how it forms historically and culturally in similar and different ways, what it's grounded in structurally, how it's enacted and embraced, how people are, and are not, converted and persuaded to new points of view, what does and doesn't work in moral instruction, and how people can extend their moral imagination into new directions and come to value what they didn't previously, can directly benefit high stakes foreign policy and save lives. For a powerful and I believe tragic depiction of how such invaluable research can be carried out, but also tends to get ignored by policy makers who favor of the kind of self evident gut reaction you espoused, I recommend Scott Atran's excellent *Talking to the Enemy: Religion, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists*. His work on how selectively catering to sacred values, as opposed to focusing on rational self interest, actually opens up dialogue between bitterly ideologically opposed groups is really eye opening.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5555782,,0,1417909416907,1.41791E+12,3,,,"['3509553', '2114195', '1296409']",

I just finished reading *Primates and Philosophers* by Frans de Waal, which featured a debate between de Waal and a bunch of philosophers largely over whether human reason and culture is actually that radical  a shift in human thinking. (I got the sense that de Waal's intuitionism made him a closet virtue ethicist, not least because of him favourably citing Mencius's willows and cups metaphor). De Waal argued against an admittedly strawman ""Veneer Theory"" where culture and reason were overlain on top of an evil human nature (think Lord of the Flies); instead, he argues that we evolved with empathy, and culture, reason, and ethics are only something like upper onion layers to this empathetic core. In response, the philosophers (an evolutionary theorist, a Kantian, a pragmatist, and a consequentialist (Peter Singer)) all agreed that reason was a radical singularity point that decisively divides humanity from everything else. Indeed, Singer's own work elsewhere suggested that we can rebel against nature using reason.So I see many parallels between this book and the one Professor Slingerland got himself into at the Beyond Belief conference. The crux of the argument is the same: must we stick to our naturalist intuitions, and is reason that decisive a break from nature--if not whether reason save us from nature? Obviously the New Atheists all argued for an empowered reason, although I found their arguments to be weak (especially if they argued on pragmatic grounds), and obviously our professor argued for sticking to what's naturally plausible. But from both that book and this course, I had new takeaway points. Whereas before I believed that Western thinkers were pessimists and Chinese thinkers were optimists vis a vis human nature (not even Han Fei could rival the pessimism of Original Sin), I now think that in addition to this optimism/pessimism foundational premise about human nature, it is the Enlightenment thinkers who are optimists and virtue ethicists and Waalian intuitionists who are pessimists insofar as how humanity can break from nature. Virtue ethicists may begin optimistically about the neutral or even good nature of human nature, but their conclusions are pessimistic about reason--we can only stick to reforming our nature, not defy it. Rationalists may be pessimistic about human nature and its inherent irrationality, but they are optimistic about reason's ability to free humanity to new heights. This is definitely not a traditional conservative-liberal divide, that's for sure.Anyway, this MOOC was one of the best I've taken (and I'm a veteran of way too many), and it's gotten me interested in moral psychology. Many thanks to Prof Slingerland for his insightful synthesis of virtue ethics and cognitive science, and for convincing me that perhaps an empirically-based virtue ethics has a chance in the 21st century. PS: I strongly recommend Prof Slingerland to read de Waal's book if he hasn't already.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1743859,0,0,1418072536519,1.41807E+12,0,Can reason save our mortal souls?,FALSE,[],discussion

To expand on his own example, a king who dies from a fatal chill because his minister of hats refused to overstep his bounds would be a failed king who could not retain power, even if one of his ministers was a better Legalist. Now I supposed the ideal king would not act on his desires to go hunt in the first place, but that still leaves open the question of how kings and ministers would deal with laws that are no longer fitting current conditions. To overturn outdated laws is to no longer obey them. If it is necessary, then how does one know of the correct circumstances to do that?  I'm not sure about the historical veracity of the Daze Xiang Uprising, but from what I understand the story goes that several hundred Qin soldiers were unavoidably delayed by rain in reporting to their new post. Since the penalty for such delay was without exception death, and the penalty for rebellion was also death, then it made sense for the soldiers to rebel and at least fight for however slim a chance to overturn the state and thus defy its laws. This then led to significant chaos and many more deaths than just the initial few hundred rebels. In ideal circumstances the penalty against tardiness seems the perfect Han Feizian law, in that it's clear, inflexible, and backed by harsh punishment. It's even bureaucratically ""wu wei"" in that the delayed troops immediately knew to take the only logical course of action open to them, without need for correspondence or intervention from the capitol. The only problem is that the consequence of such inflexible laws encountering the outlying circumstances of bad weather is without exception rebellion and chaos.  Did Han Feizi or other Legalist authors attempt to address this tension of simple and inflexible laws being ill suited for governing in complex and changing times?",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,5555782,1,0,1418090675029,1.41809E+12,0,How would the Legalist sage overturn a bad law created by his own state?,FALSE,[],question

And I'd certainly agree with you that this is one of the very best. I'd also agree with you that ""captious criticisms are trivial and unworthy""... that is almost the definition of captious.However, I regret that you see my criticism that way. This is always the danger with criticism, as my friend Ioan puts it: ""Like hunting, criticism feels as a noble sport or an assassination; depends on which side of the gun you are."" see http://wisdom.tenner.org/blog/there-are-three-kinds-of-criticism-iI was attempting Ioan's ""friendly criticism"" - obviously not successfully in your view. And yet merely telling people how wonderful they are is not always the most helpful thing to do, either.Anyone attempting wu-wei walks a tightrope over disingenuousness by implying things are easy that are not, and maybe it is unkind to point out their wobbles. Nevertheless, in the case of an academic seeking to raise their game in popularising their thinking, there are certainly good and less good models. I have pointed out both. On the good side, I have referenced Sir Ken Robinson who reminds us that if you seek to inform you must first entertain. His  TED video on ""How schools kill creativity"" is surely an object lesson in wu-wei ( http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity?language=en ), both popular (over 30 million hits) and carrying a deadly serious message. Notice how he, also, flirts with humility: ""...the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there.""Among less-good models, I have cited Dan Coyle's execrable ""The Talent Code"", also hugely popular but for all the wrong reasons, a self-help book that was effectively picked apart on a Coursera/Duke University English Composition I MOOC that I took. Coyle is a cynical snake-oil vendor, telling us what we desperately want to hear to encourage us to part with our money. Not good company for our Professor.This is not a trivial point. I respect Professor Singerland enough to believe he is capable of taking it in the spirit intended.Kind regardsGeoffrey",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1756823,,0,1418630142105,1.41864E+12,0,,,[],

One could argue that individuality is also an emergent quality of our complex brain (where the neurons and glia are the ""people""). So there is, perhaps, a personal form of we-wei as well as collective family forms (family members as the agents), neighbourhood forms (families as the agents), country forms (regions as the agents), etc., in a kind of fractal self-similarity. The quality of the different emergent forms might be different, but related. And for me, this makes the ""human nature"" and the ""cultural"" arguments compatible rather than at odds - as presented in this lecture. The ""human nature"" emergence of wu-wei would be the ""unexplainable"" incremental change based on brain~body learning just as the cultural incremental changes lead to ""unexplainable"" changes in a societal form of wu-wei.",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,2439330,,0,1419103999601,1.4191E+12,0,,,[],

I was immediately impressed by the engaging presentational style of you Prof Slingerland, the extremely high production values (way above any other MOOC I've seen) & the depth of insight combined with a very broad intellectual reasoning, thankfully presented with a self depreciatingly humourous approach which really helped promoting understanding of the topics covered.It wasn't long before I realised I'd bitten off more than I could chew however. By week three or four (I was doing around 4 Coursera MOOCs too remember)... (Oh & another EdX) I was missing deadlines & I'm afraid that pretty soon I settled on just 'auditing' the course, Heaven knows how you guys managed to keep up with all the reading materials & assignments too... phew!)But you know, I think I can unequivocally state that this course has really raised the barÉ IMHO it is the best MOOC that I have taken part in!Now I'm going to try to download all the videos , reading & reference materials & try to get stuck into it in the hope that this course is run again the same time next year. And when it is I will do my best to clear the decks for a couple of months & really give it the attention & dedication it deserves.The amount of work Prof Slingerland & his team put into this must have been great indeed & yet it truly was always presented with 'effortless mastery'.Wu Wei to go !   ;)(PS, I am posting this again as a different thread cos I really want you to seer itÉ I Hope thatÕs OK)",[],UBCx/China300x/3T2014,FALSE,1842651,,0,1419120102331,1.41912E+12,0,,,[],

(Took my title from the Mikado, Gilbert & Sullivan).I'm from Brooklyn.  I'm a patent lawyer by trade, although I'd much rather be doing something else.  Being a lawyer in general, and a patent lawyer in particular, is very much off the track of De and Wu-Wei.  I have a passing and superficial knowledge of Confucianism and Daoism, and a much greater acquaintance with Buddhism.  Part of my attraction to learning more about Chinese thought is that I find it more positive (less depressing) than Buddhism and related Indian thought. In particular while both have a soteriological aspect, Chinese thought seems to point to a ""natural"" way to get in tune, seemingly different from the stricter Middle Way in Buddhism, although they may have underlying similarities at a deeper level.Great course so far.
